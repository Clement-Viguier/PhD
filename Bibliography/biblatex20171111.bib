	abstract = {The objective of this study was to clarify the changes in the contents of endogenous carbohydrates and proline in the stolons and leaves of centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack.), during the natural cold acclimation (hardening) and de-acclimation (dehardening) in relation to freezing tolerance in the field at the transition zone between temperate and subtropical areas in China. The contents of carbohydrates and proline, and freezing tolerance estimated by {LT}50, which is the temperature at which 50\% of the electrolytes in the organ was measured in the leachate, were determined at 10-day intervals from October 1, 2001 to April 18, 2002. It was indicated that the freezing tolerance of stolons increased ({LT}50 of stolons decreased) quickly, as temperature dropped before winter, but that of leaves which senesced along with the drop in temperature did not. The freezing tolerance of stolons decreased gradually along with the rise in temperature above 5 °C in spring, when the overwintered plants started to grow. The contents of proline and soluble carbohydrates, including sucrose, fructose and glucose, increased as {LT}50 decreased when temperature dropped below 5 °C before winter, and decreased as {LT}50 increased in early spring. Correlation analysis revealed that the freezing tolerance of stolons of centipedegrass significantly and positively correlated with the contents of proline and soluble carbohydrates, and the ratio of the soluble carbohydrates to starch. Thus, the freezing tolerance of stolons, which are critical organs that determine the winter surviving ability, largely depended on the content of soluble carbohydrates and the ratio of soluble carbohydrates to starch in centipedegrass. The possible relationship between freezing tolerance and carbohydrate metabolism was also discussed.},

	abstract = {Interspecific variation in leaf life span reflects the variation in nutrient conservation ability among different plant species and is considered to be associated with nutrient availability in the characteristic habitat. As defoliation interferes with nutrient conservation by the long-lived leaves, we hypothesized that disturbance rate is another important environmental factor working as a selective force on interspecific variation in leaf life span. In order to investigate this, we measured leaf life span of 32 grass species in mature garden-grown individuals. Variation in leaf life span was compared to measured leaf traits, to available data on species occurrence along gradients of nutrient availability and disturbance, and to published relative growth rates of the species. Leaf life span was associated positively with leaf tissue mass density and negatively with specific leaf area. Leaf life span correlated negatively with the disturbance rate in the characteristic habitat of a species, but not with nutrient availability. The latter relationship did not come about due to the long leaf life spans of species from nutrient-rich habitats with a relatively low disturbance rate, and to some extent also due to the short leaf life spans of annual species from relatively nutrient-poor sites. We conclude that although leaf longevity is an important means of reducing nutrient losses, this is a selective advantage only if the plant is not subjected to frequent defoliation. The frequently postulated association between leaf life span of a species and nutrient availability in its characteristic habitat may occur among species of habitats with positively correlated nutrient availability and disturbance rate. Leaf life span is negatively associated with seedling {RGR}, but there may be deviations in this relationship due to species with contrasting characteristics at seedling stage and at maturity.},

	abstract = {Leaf longevity in 29 herbaceous plant species of Central Europe was studied by inspecting tagged leaves at weekly intervals. About half of the species are elements of the lowland meadow flora, the other half comprises a representative sample of species from the highest sites where vascular plants grow in the Alps. Shaded and water-stressed sites were avoided. Overall mean leaf longevity did not differ significantly between sites and amounted to 71 ± 5 days at low and 68 ± 4 days at high altitude. Leaf life spans ranged (with no clear altitudinal trend) from 41 to 95 days. Low-altitude forbs and grasses produced several leaf cohorts during their growth period, while most alpine species produced only one. Correlations were found between leaf duration and percent nitrogen content and carbon-cost/carbon-gain ratios, but not with leaf dry mass per unit leaf area and photosynthetic capacity alone. As leaf life spans increase, more C tends to be invested per unit {CO}₂ uptake and less N is invested per unit invested C. Thus, mass relationships rather than area relationships seem to be linked to leaf life span in these species, suggesting that leaf duration is associated with properties other than the efficiency of light utilization (e.g. mechanical strength, herbivory or pathogen resistance). It seems that the explanations of leaf duration that have been developed for evergreen/deciduous plants and for plants along steep light gradients do not apply to the variable life spans in leaves of perennial herbaceous plants of open habitats.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities and their response to environmental gradients are increasingly being described by various measures of trait composition. Aggregated trait averages (i.e. averages of trait values of constituent species, weighted by species proportions) are popular indices reflecting the functional characteristics of locally dominant species. Because the variation of these indices along environmental gradients can be caused by both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, it is necessary to disentangle the role of both components to community variability. For quantitative traits, trait averages can be calculated from ‘fixed’ trait values (i.e. a single mean trait value for individual species used for all habitats where the species is found) or trait values for individual species specific to each plot, or habitat, where the species is found. Changes in fixed averages across environments reflect species turnover, while changes in specific traits reflect both species turnover and within-species variability in traits. Here we suggest a practical method (accompanied by a set of R functions) that, by combining ‘fixed’ and ‘specific averages’, disentangles the effect of species turnover, intraspecific trait variability, and their covariation. These effects can be further decomposed into parts ascribed to individual explanatory variables (i.e. treatments or environmental gradients considered). The method is illustrated with a case study from a factorial mowing and fertilization experiment in a meadow in South Bohemia. Results show that the variability decomposition differs markedly among traits studied (height, Specific Leaf Area, Leaf N, P, C concentrations, leaf and stem dry matter content), both according to the relative importance of species turnover and intraspecific variability, and also according to their response to experimental factors. Both the effect of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover must be taken into account when assessing the functional role of community trait structure. Neglecting intraspecific trait variability across habitats often results in underestimating the response of communities to environmental changes.},

Frost resistance ({LT}50) ranged from −4.5 to −14.6 °C and appeared insufficient to protect against air temperature minima, corroborating reports of natural frost damage. All species tolerated extracellular ice formation (recorded at −1.9 ± 0.2 °C; E1). Initial frost damage occurred at average temperatures 4.9 K below E1. In 64\% of the species a second exotherm (E2) and frost damage were recorded between −3.7 and −9.4 °C. In the highest ranging species E2 was not detectable. Frost resistance increased with increasing upper distribution boundary (0.4 K per 100 m), corresponding well with the altitudinal decrease in air temperature minima. No relationship between plant stature and frost resistance was found. Graminoids were significantly frost hardier than other growth forms. Frost survival at high altitudes will depend not only on altitudinal increase in frost resistance but also on freezing avoidance strategies, snow cover protection and a high recuperation capacity.},

Here, we collected wool materials produced from 1962 to 2010 and investigated the long-term {WUE} of an alpine meadow in Tibet on basis of the carbon isotope values of vegetation (δ13Cveg). The values of δ13Cveg decreased by 1.34‰ during 1962–2010, similar to changes in δ13C values of atmospheric {CO}2. Carbon isotope discrimination was highly variable and no trend was apparent in the past half century. Intrinsic water use efficiency (Wi) increased by 18 μmol·mol–1 (approximately 23.5\%) during 1962–2010 because the increase in the intercellular {CO}2 concentration (46 μmol·mol–1) was less than that in the atmospheric {CO}2 concentration (Ca, 73 μmol·mol–1). In addition, Wi increased significantly with increasing growing season temperature and Ca. However, effective water use efficiency (We) remained relatively stable, because of increasing vapor pressure deficit. Ca, precipitation, and growing season temperature collectively explained 45\% of the variation of We. Our findings indicate that the We of alpine meadows in the Tibetan Plateau remained relatively stable by physiological adjustment to elevated Ca and growing season temperature. These findings improve our understanding and the capacity to predict {NPP} of these ecosystems under global change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Because Farquhar’s photosynthesis model is only directly applicable to individual leaves instantaneously, considerable skill is needed to use this model for regional plant growth and carbon budget estimations. In many published models, Farquhar’s equations were applied directly to plant canopies by assuming a plant canopy to function like a big-leaf. This big-leaf approximation is found to be acceptable for estimating seasonal trends of canopy photosynthesis but inadequate for simulating its day-to-day variations, when compared with eddy-covariance and gas-exchange chamber measurements from two boreal forests. The daily variation is greatly dampened in big-leaf simulations because the original leaf-level model is partially modified through replacing stomatal conductance with canopy conductance. Alternative approaches such as separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups or stratifying the canopy into multiple layers can avoid the problem. Because of non-linear response of leaf photosynthesis to meteorological variables (radiation, temperature and humidity), considerable errors exist in photosynthesis calculation at daily steps without considering the diurnal variability of the variables. To avoid these non-linear effects, we have developed an analytical solution to a simplified daily integral of Farquhar’s model by considering the general diurnal patterns of meteorological variables. This daily model not only captures the main effects of diurnal variations on photosynthesis but is also computationally efficient for large area applications. Its application is then not restricted by availability of sub-daily meteorological data. This scheme has been tested using measured {CO}2 data from the Boreal Ecosystem–Atmosphere Study ({BOREAS}), which took place in Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 1994 and 1996.},

Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

Despite this recognized shortcoming, it is unclear which processes warrant attention in model development, given the computational cost of additional model complexity. Here, we tested the sensitivity of four models to adjustments in fine root turnover in forested systems: {CENTURY}, {ED}2, {MC}1, and {LANDCARB}. In general, faster root turnover rates resulted in lower total system carbon (C) and within model changes ranged from 1\% to 38\% following 100-year simulations. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes differed among models as some expressed lower net primary productivity ({NPP}) with faster turnover rates and others had similar {NPP} but large shifts in C allocation away from wood to fine roots. Based on these findings we expect that different model responses to changes in fine root turnover will be determined by (1) whether C is allocated to fine roots as fixed portion of {NPP} or to maintain a fixed biomass ratio between fine roots and leaves or stems and (2) whether soil nutrient and water uptake is a function of both resource availability and fine root biomass or based on resource availability alone. These results suggest that better constrained estimates of fine root turnover will represent a valuable improvement in many terrestrial biosphere models.},

Summary

There is wide breadth of root function within ecosystems that should be considered when modeling the terrestrial biosphere. Root structure and function are closely associated with control of plant water and nutrient uptake from the soil, plant carbon (C) assimilation, partitioning and release to the soils, and control of biogeochemical cycles through interactions within the rhizosphere. Root function is extremely dynamic and dependent on internal plant signals, root traits and morphology, and the physical, chemical and biotic soil environment. While plant roots have significant structural and functional plasticity to changing environmental conditions, their dynamics are noticeably absent from the land component of process-based Earth system models used to simulate global biogeochemical cycling. Their dynamic representation in large-scale models should improve model veracity. Here, we describe current root inclusion in models across scales, ranging from mechanistic processes of single roots to parameterized root processes operating at the landscape scale. With this foundation we discuss how existing and future root functional knowledge, new data compilation efforts, and novel modeling platforms can be leveraged to enhance root functionality in large-scale terrestrial biosphere models by improving parameterization within models, and introducing new components such as dynamic root distribution and root functional traits linked to resource extraction.},

Summary

There is wide breadth of root function within ecosystems that should be considered when modeling the terrestrial biosphere. Root structure and function are closely associated with control of plant water and nutrient uptake from the soil, plant carbon (C) assimilation, partitioning and release to the soils, and control of biogeochemical cycles through interactions within the rhizosphere. Root function is extremely dynamic and dependent on internal plant signals, root traits and morphology, and the physical, chemical and biotic soil environment. While plant roots have significant structural and functional plasticity to changing environmental conditions, their dynamics are noticeably absent from the land component of process-based Earth system models used to simulate global biogeochemical cycling. Their dynamic representation in large-scale models should improve model veracity. Here, we describe current root inclusion in models across scales, ranging from mechanistic processes of single roots to parameterized root processes operating at the landscape scale. With this foundation we discuss how existing and future root functional knowledge, new data compilation efforts, and novel modeling platforms can be leveraged to enhance root functionality in large-scale terrestrial biosphere models by improving parameterization within models, and introducing new components such as dynamic root distribution and root functional traits linked to resource extraction.},

However, limitations in data and confusions over terminology, together with a strong dependence on a small set of conceptual frameworks, have limited the exploration of root function in terrestrial models. We review the key root processes of interest to both field ecologists and modelers including root classification, production, turnover, biomass, resource uptake, and depth distribution to ask (1) what are contemporary approaches for modeling roots in terrestrial models? and (2) can these approaches be improved via recent advancements in field research methods? We isolate several emerging themes that are ready for collaboration among field scientists and modelers: (1) alternatives to size-class based root classifications based on function and the inclusion of fungal symbioses, (2) dynamic root allocation and phenology as a function of root environment, rather than leaf demand alone, (3) improved understanding of the treatment of root turnover in models, including the role of root tissue chemistry on root lifespan, (4) better estimates of root stocks across sites and species to parameterize or validate models, and (5) dynamic interplay among rooting depth, resource availability and resource uptake. Greater attention to model parameterization and structural representation of roots will lead to greater appreciation for belowground processes in terrestrial models and improve estimates of ecosystem resilience to global change drivers.},

Game theory provides a mathematical language for understanding evolution by natural selection. Continuous-trait game theory starts with the notion of an evolutionarily stable strategy ({ESS}) and adds the concept of convergence stability (that the {ESS} is an evolutionary attractor). With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades. Going forward we emphasize the communication of the conceptual simplicity and underlying unity of ideas inherent in continuous-trait game theory and the development of new applications to biological questions.},

The model predicts the most competitive (i.e., the evolutionarily stable strategy [{ESS}]) allocations to foliage, wood, and fine roots for canopy and understory stages of trees growing in old-growth forests. The {ESS} allocations, revealed as analytical functions of commonly measured physiological parameters, depend not on simple root-shoot relations but rather on diminishing returns of carbon investment that ensure any alternate strategy will underperform an {ESS} in monoculture because of the competitive environment that the {ESS} creates. As such, {ESS} allocations do not maximize nitrogen-limited growth rates in monoculture, highlighting the underappreciated idea that the most competitive strategy is not necessarily the “best,” but rather that which creates conditions in which all others are “worse.” Data from 152 stands support the model’s surprising prediction that the dominant structural trade-off is between fine roots and wood, not foliage, suggesting the “root-shoot” trade-off is more precisely a “root-stem” trade-off for long-lived trees. Assuming other resources are abundant, the model predicts that forests are limited by both nitrogen and light, or nearly so.},

The species expressed large intraspecific variation in the leaf economic traits at all of the three spatial scales. It also showed strong covariation among the four leaf economic traits across the species range. The coordination among leaf economic traits resulted in {LES} at all three scales and the environmental variables determining variation in leaf economic traits were different among the spatial scales. Our results provide novel evidence for within-species {LES} at multiple spatial scales, indicating that resource trade-off could also constrain intraspecific trait variation mainly driven by climatic and/or edaphic differences.},

	abstract = {Plants are limited in their ability to choose their neighbours, but they are able to orchestrate a wide spectrum of rational competitive behaviours that increase their prospects to prevail under various ecological settings. Through the perception of neighbours, plants are able to anticipate probable competitive interactions and modify their competitive behaviours to maximize their long-term gains. Specifically, plants can minimize competitive encounters by avoiding their neighbours; maximize their competitive effects by aggressively confronting their neighbours; or tolerate the competitive effects of their neighbours. However, the adaptive values of these non-mutually exclusive options are expected to depend strongly on the plants' evolutionary background and to change dynamically according to their past development, and relative sizes and vigour. Additionally, the magnitude of competitive responsiveness is expected to be positively correlated with the reliability of the environmental information regarding the expected competitive interactions and the expected time left for further plastic modifications. Concurrent competition over external and internal resources and morphogenetic signals may enable some plants to increase their efficiency and external competitive performance by discriminately allocating limited resources to their more promising organs at the expense of failing or less successful organs.},

Game theory provides the tools to characterise such density- and frequency-dependent interactions. Here, we review the contributions of game theory to plant ecology. After briefly reviewing game theory from the perspective of plant ecology, we divide our review into three sections. First, game theoretical models of allocation to shoots and roots often predict investment in those organs beyond what would be optimal in the absence of competition. Second, game theoretical models of enemy defence suggest that an individual's investment in defence is not only a means of reducing its own tissue damage but also a means of deflecting enemies onto competitors. Finally, game theoretical models of trade with mutualistic partners suggest that the optimal trade may reflect competition for access to mutualistic partners among plants. In short, our review provides an accessible entrance to game theory that will help plant ecologists enrich their research with its worldview and existing predictions.},

Here, I will outline the theoretical barriers that have precluded the opportunity to experimentally test such behavioural/cognitive phenomena in plants. I will then suggest concrete alternative approaches to cognition by highlighting how (i) the environment offers a multitude of opportunities for decision-making and action and makes behaviours possible, rather than causing them; (ii) perception in itself is action in the form of a continuous flow of information; (iii) all living organisms viewed within this context become agents endowed with autonomy rather than objects in a mechanistically conceived world.

The probability of meeting one’s own genes for wasteful competition is higher in communities where clonality prevails (and relatively high mean intra-species relatedness is expected), and higher in communities with low species diversity. On the other hand, lower diversity indicates a higher average fitness of species since the (finite) total pool of resources is distributed among fewer population with high density. I show, using four community types with contrasting diversity and clonality that community fitness (average fitness in the assemblage of species) can be expressed as the product of two variables––anti-diversity and degree of sexuality.},

	abstract = {The allocation of resources among roots and shoots represents the largest flux of resources within a plant and therefore should have been selected to maximize benefits to plants. Yet, it is unclear why some species like temperate grasses have such high root length density ({RLD}). Either the slow rate of diffusion of inorganic N in soils or interplant competition could explain the high {RLD} of temperate grasses. Using a fine-scale model of nutrient dynamics in the soil and plant growth, a cost–benefit approach was used to assess optimal allocation rates for plants that accounted for value of both carbon and nitrogen. In the absence of interplant competition, resource benefits are maximized with very little root length except in extremely dry soils for ammonium. In the presence of a competitor, optimal allocation of N to roots is much greater and increases as ability of competitors to produce root length increase. Competition for inorganic nitrogen generates a classic aspect of the tragedy of the commons, the “race for fish”, where plants must allocate more resources to acquisition of the limiting resource than is optimal for plants in the absence of competition. As such, nutrient competition needs to be directly addressed when understanding plant- and ecosystem-level resource fluxes as well as the evolution of root systems.},

	abstract = {Plants are highly plastic in their potential to adapt to changing environmental conditions. For example, they can selectively promote the relative growth of the root and the shoot in response to limiting supply of mineral nutrients and light, respectively, a phenomenon that is referred to as balanced growth or functional equilibrium. To gain insight into the regulatory network that controls this phenomenon, we took a systems biology approach that combines experimental work with mathematical modeling. We developed a mathematical model representing the activities of the root (nutrient and water uptake) and the shoot (photosynthesis), and their interactions through the exchange of the substrates sugar and phosphate (Pi). The model has been calibrated and validated with two independent experimental data sets obtained with Petunia hybrida. It involves a realistic environment with a day-and-night cycle, which necessitated the introduction of a transitory carbohydrate storage pool and an endogenous clock for coordination of metabolism with the environment. Our main goal was to grasp the dynamic adaptation of shoot:root ratio as a result of changes in light and Pi supply. The results of our study are in agreement with balanced growth hypothesis, suggesting that plants maintain a functional equilibrium between shoot and root activity based on differential growth of these two compartments. Furthermore, our results indicate that resource partitioning can be understood as the emergent property of many local physiological processes in the shoot and the root without explicit partitioning functions. Based on its encouraging predictive power, the model will be further developed as a tool to analyze resource partitioning in shoot and root crops.},

	abstract = {Clonal plants grow by the production of semi-autonomous modules (ramets), and form complex branching structures which may provide communication/resource flow channels between the units. These characteristic features have made clonal plants a challenging subject for spatial modelling. We review the advance of ideas and new directions in theoretical research since the last review (Oborny and Cain, 1997). We place clonal growth models into a general framework of spatial population dynamic models, comparing individual ramets of a clone with individuals in a non-clonal population. We discuss three specificities of clonal spreading: (1) ramets can be physiologically integrated through the network of branching structures; (2) formation of new ramets occurs by the growth of these branching structures which can be directional, following architectural rules; and (3) formation of new ramets can be adjusted to the environment by phenotypic plasticity. We review methods by which these traits have been implemented into models. We summarize model predictions, for the spatial structure and fitness of clonal plants, and link these predictions with existing empirical data. Emphasis is given to the contributions that theoretical studies could provide for experimental studies in the field.

We emphasize the following recent major developments: (i) a much better understanding of emergent consequences of various clonal growth rules over broad spatial and temporal scales has been reached. (ii) Links have been found to other complex systems. For example, a key problem of integration vs. splitting of connecting structures has been shown to be closely related to a problem in percolation theory. (iii) Interactions between physiological integration, architectural growth and plastic responses have been demonstrated; research on these interactions has generally shown a large degree of contingency in the effects of these traits. Finally, we outline some areas for future research.},

The eggplant based simulation results show that simple rules and actions (internal carbon allocation among organs, dynamic carbon reserve/mobilization, carbon transport in parallel using a discrete pressure-flow paradigm and child agent position choosing for maximum light interception, etc.) executed by agents can cause the complex adaptive behaviors on the whole plant level: carbon partitioning among metamers and roots, carbon reserve dynamics, architecture and biomass adaptation to environmental heterogeneity and the phototropism, etc. This phenomenon manifest that the virtual plant simulated in presented approach can be viewed as a complex adaptive system.},

	abstract = {Plants are exemplified by high plasticity in resource allocation strategies which allows them to maximize their fitness under changing resource conditions. In many plant species, obtaining resources involves mutualistic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ({AMF}), where plants provide the {AMF} with sugars in exchange for soil nutrients like phosphorus (P). These nutrient exchange rates have high context dependency, influenced by both the cooperative level of the {AMF} species involved (a qualitative trait) and the ambient nutrient concentrations in the soil (a quantitative value). Because this context dependency arises from a mix of both quantitative and qualitative factors, standard ordinary differential equation ({ODE}) modeling methods often complicate the representation of resource allocation strategies. Here, we explore the utility of a hybrid automata modeling framework that can intuitively combine the qualitative {AMF} traits and quantitative nutrient concentrations. This allows for a better analysis and understanding of phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation in the plant–{AMF}, and other nutrient exchange mutualisms. We consider a focal strategy in which nutrients are allocated to growth at times of nutrient limitations, and to storage otherwise and ask how this changes plant allocation to growth vs. storage. We first model this system dynamically to show how the plant responds to different environmental conditions and interacts with {AMF} and show that our hybrid automata model can replicate experimental data from the plant–{AMF} system. From our work, novel perceptions into the well-studied plant–{AMF} symbiosis and testable hypotheses can be underlined: (1) leaf biomass does not increase proportionally with the level of {AMF} cooperation; (2) in the context of multiple {AMF} simultaneously colonizing a host–plant, a narrow variance of response is observed and explained by an auction-like mechanism of the {AMF} to acquire C from the plant.},

	abstract = {We review approaches to predicting carbon and nitrogen allocation in forest models in terms of their underlying assumptions and their resulting strengths and limitations. Empirical and allometric methods are easily developed and computationally efficient, but lack the power of evolution-based approaches to explain and predict multifaceted effects of environmental variability and climate change. In evolution-based methods, allocation is usually determined by maximization of a fitness proxy, either in a fixed environment, which we call optimal response ({OR}) models, or including the feedback of an individual's strategy on its environment (game-theoretical optimization, {GTO}). Optimal response models can predict allocation in single trees and stands when there is significant competition only for one resource. Game-theoretical optimization can be used to account for additional dimensions of competition, e.g., when strong root competition boosts root allocation at the expense of wood production. However, we demonstrate that an {OR} model predicts similar allocation to a {GTO} model under the root-competitive conditions reported in free-air carbon dioxide enrichment ({FACE}) experiments. The most evolutionarily realistic approach is adaptive dynamics ({AD}) where the allocation strategy arises from eco-evolutionary dynamics of populations instead of a fitness proxy. We also discuss emerging entropy-based approaches that offer an alternative thermodynamic perspective on allocation, in which fitness proxies are replaced by entropy or entropy production. To help develop allocation models further, the value of wide-ranging datasets, such as {FLUXNET}, could be greatly enhanced by ancillary measurements of driving variables, such as water and soil nitrogen availability.},

We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model’s predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic.},

Regarding timing of flowering as an integrated part of both the annual cycle and of the whole life cycle, rather than as an isolated event, has important implications for how we assess selection on timing of reproduction and interpret existing phenological patterns in perennial plants. I argue that: 1) we have little unequivocal evidence of pollinator-mediated selection on flowering time, but perhaps more evidence of antagonist-mediated selection; 2) much of selection on flowering time might occur before flowers have developed and after reproduction; 3) vital rates of non-flowering individuals can influence the strength and direction of selection on flowering time, and 4) differences in the direction of selection on flowering date between years might well correspond to consistent selection on the mechanisms determining flowering time. Overall, a life cycle perspective on timing of flowering is likely to facilitate the identification of selective agents and the understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying spatial and temporal variation in selection as well as to enable more accurate predictions of responses to environmental change.},

Virtually all biological phenomena—from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes—have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

With such a mechanistic understanding, scientists can better predict phenological responses to novel seasonal climates. Using the widespread model species Arabidopsis thaliana, we explore how variation in different genetic pathways can be linked to phenology and life-history variation across geographical regions and seasons. We show that the expression of phenological traits including flowering depends critically on the growth season, and we outline an integrated life-history approach to phenology in which the timing of later life-history events can be contingent on the environmental cues regulating earlier life stages. As flowering time in many plants is determined by the integration of multiple environmentally sensitive gene pathways, the novel combinations of important seasonal cues in projected future climates will alter how phenology responds to variation in the flowering time gene network with important consequences for plant life history. We discuss how phenology models in other systems—both natural and agricultural—could employ a similar framework to explore the potential contribution of genetic variation to the physiological integration of cues determining phenology.},

Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

More than 200 000 records for six phenological events (leaf unfolding, flowering, fruit ripening, fruit harvesting, leaf falling and growing season) of 29 perennial species for the period 1943–2003 recorded throughout Spain provide the longest temporal and the broadest spatial assessment of plant phenology changes in the Mediterranean region. The overwhelming majority of the 118 studied phenophases shifted their dates in recent decades. Such changes differed among phenological events. Leaf unfolding, flowering and fruiting are markedly advancing (−0.48, −0.59 and −0.32 days yr−1, respectively), but only since the mid-1970s. Anemophilous have advanced more days their flowering than entomophilous. However, some species have delayed and others have advanced their leaf falling dates and as a result only a weak shift was observed in this event for the whole of the studied species (+0.12 days yr−1). The growing season lengthened by 18 days, which implies an increase of 8\% in the life of annual leaves. Such an increase was achieved mainly through the advance of leaf unfolding dates in the spring, one of the most productive times of year for vegetation in the Mediterranean. Shifts in the plant calendar were accompanied as well by long-term changes in the range of onset dates in 39\% of studied phenophases. Leaf unfolding, flowering and growing season tended to reduce spatial variability, reflecting a faster and more synchronized onset (or duration) of phenophases across the study area. Changes in spatial variability may aggravate calendar mismatching with other trophic levels resulting from changes in dates. Because temporal responses differed markedly among species, calendar guilds of plants have changed, which suggests alterations of interspecific relationships in plant communities from Mediterranean ecosystems.},

A three-year reciprocal translocation experiment was performed along an elevation gradient from 3200 m to 3800 m in the Tibetan Plateau for six alpine plants. Transplanting to lower elevation (warming) advanced the first flowering date ({FFD}) and transplanting to higher elevation (cooling) had the opposite effect. The {FFD} of early spring flowering plants ({ESF}) was four times less sensitive to warming than to cooling (by −2.1 d/°C and 8.4 d/°C, respectively), while midsummer flowering plants ({MSF}) were about twice as sensitive to warming than to cooling (−8.0 d/°C and 4.9 d/°C, respectively). Compared with pooled warming and cooling data, warming alone significantly underpredicted 3.1 d/°C for {ESF} and overestimated 1.7 d/°C for {MSF}. These results suggest that future empirical and experimental studies should consider nonlinear temperature responses that can cause such warming–cooling asymmetries as well as differing life strategies ({ESF} vs. {MSF}) among plant species.},

* •Here I show for 347 species that the extent to which {FFD} has responded to climate warming is linked to the degree to which their relative distributions have changed over 30 yr across the British Isles.
* •Native plant species whose phenology did not track climate change declined in distribution, whereas species that became more widespread all exhibited earlier flowering. In contrast, alien neophytes showed both a stronger phenological response to warming and a more marked increase in distribution, but no link between the two.
* •These trends were consistent both for relative changes in the national distribution and for local abundance. At the national scale, the more recently an alien species became established in Britain, the more likely it was to increase in distribution irrespective of {FFD}, suggesting that recent changes in alien species distributions are decoupled from climate and driven by other factors.},

	abstract = {The main way in which plants can exert control over their local environment is by the timing of different events within their life cycles. Regarding timing of flowering as an integrated part of both the annual cycle and of the whole life cycle, rather than as an isolated event, has important implications for how we assess selection on timing of reproduction and interpret existing phenological patterns in perennial plants. I argue that: 1) we have little unequivocal evidence of pollinator-mediated selection on flowering time, but perhaps more evidence of antagonist-mediated selection; 2) much of selection on flowering time might occur before flowers have developed and after reproduction; 3) vital rates of non-flowering individuals can influence the strength and direction of selection on flowering time, and 4) differences in the direction of selection on flowering date between years might well correspond to consistent selection on the mechanisms determining flowering time. Overall, a life cycle perspective on timing of flowering is likely to facilitate the identification of selective agents and the understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying spatial and temporal variation in selection as well as to enable more accurate predictions of responses to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Autumn senescence regulates multiple aspects of ecosystem function, along with associated feedbacks to the climate system. Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground- and satellite-based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year-to-year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future {CO}2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

The model is tested using 8 years of soil temperature data, and three years of bud break data of Betula nana. Because the factors that trigger the end of the growing season of arctic vegetation are less well known than those of the start of the growing season, three hypotheses were formulated and tested for their effects on productivity and its sensitivity to climate change; the hypothesised factors determining the end of the growing season were frost, photoperiod and periodic constraints. The performance of the soil thermal model was good; both the onset of soil thaw in spring and the initiation of freezing in autumn were predicted correctly in most cases. The phenology model predicted the bud break date of Betula nana closely for the three different years. The soil thaw model predicted similar growing season start dates under current climate as the models based on sum of temperatures, but it made significantly different predictions under climate change scenarios, probably because of the non-linear interactions between snowmelt and soil thaw. The uncertainty about the driving factors for the end of the growing season, in turn, resulted in uncertainty in the interannual variability of the simulated annual gross primary productivity ({GPP}). The interannual variability ranged from − 25 to + 26\% of the mean annual {GPP} for the frost hypothesis, from − 20 to + 20\% for the photoperiod hypothesis and only from − 7 to + 7\% for the periodic hypothesis. The different hypotheses also resulted in different sensitivity to climate change, with the frost hypothesis resulting in 30\% higher annual {GPP} values than the periodic hypothesis when air temperatures were increased by 3 °C.},

Environmental and genetic phenotype determination are the two main categories of polymorphic development. Even though both may evolve as a response to varied environments, they are traditionally regarded as fundamentally distinct phenomena. They can however be joined into a single framework that emphasizes the parallel roles of environmental and genetic cues in phenotype determination. First, from the point of view of immediate causation, it is common that phenotypic variants can be induced either by environmental or by allelic variation, and this is referred to as gene-environment interchangeability. Second, from the point of view of adaptation, genetic cues in the form of allelic variation at polymorphic loci can play similar roles as environmental cues in providing information to the developmental system about coming selective conditions. Both types of cues can help a developing organism to fit its phenotype to selective circumstances. This perspective of information in environmental and genetic cues can produce testable hypotheses about phenotype determination, and can thus increase our understanding of the evolution of phenotypic polymorphism.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} Phenotypic plasticity is the primitive character state for most if not all traits. Insofar as developmental and physiological processes obey the laws of chemistry and physics, they will be sensitive to such environmental variables as temperature, nutrient supply, ionic environment, and the availability of various macro- and micronutrients. Depending on the effect this phenotypic plasticity has on fitness, evolution may proceed to select either for mechanisms that buffer or canalize the phenotype against relevant environmental variation or for a modified plastic response in which some ranges of the phenotypic variation are adaptive to particular environments. Phenotypic plasticity can be continuous, in which case it is called a reaction norm, or discontinuous, in which case it is called a polyphenism. Although the morphological discontinuity of some polyphenisms is produced by discrete developmental switches, most polyphenisms are due to discontinuities in the environment that induce only portions of what is in reality a continuous reaction norm. In insect polyphenisms, the environmental variable that induces the alternative phenotype is a token stimulus that serves as a predictor of, but is not itself, the environment to which the polyphenism is an adaptation. In all cases studied so far, the environmental stimulus alters the endocrine mechanism of metamorphosis by altering either the pattern of hormone secretion or the pattern of hormone sensitivity in different tissues. Such changes in the patterns of endocrine interactions result in the execution of alternative developmental pathways. The spatial and temporal compartmentalization of endocrine interactions has produced a developmental mechanism that enables substantial localized changes in morphology that remain well integrated into the structure and function of the organism.},

However, patterns of variation in {SLA} and {SRL} have rarely been examined simultaneously across evolutionary history and environmental gradients, and the {SLA}–{SRL} relationship is still controversial on several grounds.


* We examined the inter- and intraspecific variations in {SLA} and {SRL} of different root branching orders and the {SLA}–{SRL} relationship across 55 species and 21 plant communities of four vegetation types along a 2000-km transect in the Inner Mongolia grassland.


* With increasing root branching order, the interspecific variation in {SRL} increased, but the intraspecific variation in {SRL} decreased considerably, and the form of {SLA}–{SRL} relationship shifted from positive to negative. This indicates that acquisition of soil resources (e.g. water and nutrients) is a fundamental strategy for plant investment to root length. When inter- and intraspecific variations in {SLA} and {SRLs} were partitioned into alpha (within-community) and beta (among-community) components, the alpha component exhibited substantially greater inter- and intraspecific variations than the beta component.


* Across the transect, the evolutionarily late diverged species in phylogenetic tree evolved towards low {SLA} and {SRL}-1 ({SRL} for first-order roots) and tended to distribute in resource-poor conditions along the environmental gradient. The early diverged species, in contrast, had high {SLA} and {SRL}-1 and mostly distributed in resource-rich conditions.


* Our findings suggest that patterns of inter- and intraspecific variations in {SLA} and {SRL} of different root branching orders and the form of {SLA}–{SRL} relationship could be well explained by within- and among-community filtering processes and species divergence time. Coordination and trade-offs between leaves and roots do not mutually exclude but operate simultaneously at different scales and among different root branching orders in arid and semi-arid grasslands.},

However, this conceptual model has not yet been experimentally validated. The aim of this work was to experimentally evaluate the effect of aridity and grazing, as selective forces, on drought and grazing resistance of populations of Trichloris crinita, a native perennial forage grass of the Argentinean Arid Chaco region. We collected seeds in sites with four different combinations of aridity and grazing history (semiarid/subhumid × heavily grazed/lightly grazed), established them in pots in a common garden, and subjected the resulting plants to different combinations of drought and defoliation. Our results agreed with the convergence model. Aridity has selected T. crinita genotypes that respond better to drought and defoliation in terms of sexual reproduction and leaf growth, and that can evade grazing due to a lower shoot : root ratio and a higher resource allocation to reserves (starch) in stem bases. Similarly, grazing has selected genotypes that respond better to drought and defoliation in terms of sexual reproduction and that can evade grazing due to a lower digestibility of leaf blades. These results allow us to extend concepts of previous models in plant adaptation to herbivory to models on plant adaptation to drought. The only variable in which we obtained a result opposite to predictions was plant height, as plants from semiarid sites were taller (and with more erect tillers) than plants from subhumid sites; we hypothesize that this result might have been a consequence of the selection exerted by the high solar radiation and soil temperatures of semiarid sites. In addition, our work allows for the prediction of the effects of dry or wet growing seasons on the performance of T. crinita plants. Our results suggest that we can rely on dry environments for selecting grazing-resistant genotypes and on high grazing pressure history environments for selecting drought-resistant ones.},

Although ecologists have long acknowledged species/' direct physiological and demographic responses to climate, more recent work suggests that these direct responses can be overwhelmed by indirect effects mediated via other interacting community members. Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate. Empirical tests of this prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing interactions between competitors that co-occur today. To explore how species/' responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species/' responses to climate change accurately.},

	abstract = {In experimental plant communities, relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have been found to strengthen over time, a fact often attributed to increased resource complementarity between species in mixtures and negative plant–soil feedbacks in monocultures. Here we show that selection for niche differentiation between species can drive this increasing biodiversity effect. Growing 12 grassland species in test monocultures and mixtures, we found character displacement between species and increased biodiversity effects when plants had been selected over 8 years in species mixtures rather than in monocultures. When grown in mixtures, relative differences in height and specific leaf area between plant species selected in mixtures (mixture types) were greater than between species selected in monocultures (monoculture types). Furthermore, net biodiversity and complementarity effects were greater in mixtures of mixture types than in mixtures of monoculture types. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism for the increase in biodiversity effects: selection for increased niche differentiation through character displacement. Selection in diverse mixtures may therefore increase species coexistence and ecosystem functioning in natural communities and may also allow increased mixture yields in agriculture or forestry. However, loss of biodiversity and prolonged selection of crops in monoculture may compromise this potential for selection in the longer term.},

	abstract = {1. Spatially explicit understanding of the delivery of multiple ecosystem services ({ES}) from global to local scales is currently limited. New studies analysing the simultaneous provision of multiple services at landscape scale should aid the understanding of multiple {ES} delivery and trade-offs to support policy, management and land planning. 2. Here, we propose a new approach for the analysis, mapping and understanding of multiple {ES} delivery in landscapes. Spatially explicit single {ES} models based on plant traits and abiotic characteristics are combined to identify ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ spots of multiple {ES} delivery, and the land use and biotic determinants of such distributions. We demonstrate the value of this trait-based approach as compared to a pure land-use approach for a pastoral landscape from the central French Alps, and highlight how it improves understanding of ecological constraints to, and opportunities for, the delivery of multiple services. 3. Vegetative height and leaf traits such as leaf dry matter content were response traits strongly influenced by land use and abiotic environment, with follow-on effects on several ecosystem properties, and could therefore be used as functional markers of {ES}. 4. Patterns of association among {ES} were related to the dominant traits underlying different ecosystem properties. The functional decoupling between height and leaf traits provided alternative pathways for high agronomic value, as well as determining hot and cold spots of {ES}. Traditional land uses such as organic fertilization and mowing or altitude summer grazing were also linked with {ES} hot spots, because functional characteristics supporting fodder production and quality are compatible with species and functional diversity. 5. Synthesis. Analyses of {ES} using plant functional variation across landscapes are a powerful approach to understanding the fundamental ecological mechanisms underlying {ES} provision, and trade-offs or synergies among services. Sustainable management of species and functionally diverse grassland could simultaneously aim at conserving biodiversity and locally important {ES} by taking advantage of correlations and trade-offs among different plant functional traits.},

How are livestock type and stocking rate related to changes in vegetation structure and composition? Location: Sub-alpine grasslands in the central and eastern Pyrenees. Methods: Multivariate analysis and variance partitioning methods were used to evaluate the relative roles of environmental factors in structuring vegetation composition and diversity patterns in three surveys on differently managed grasslands. Results: Vegetation composition within a region was affected by environmental factors hierarchically, changing first according to abiotic factors and then to grazing management. At landscape scales, abiotic factors explained two-fold more variation in vegetation composition than grazing factors. Within landscape units, cattle grazing increased vegetation heterogeneity at landscape and patch scales, while sheep grazing favoured the presence of a specific set of species with high conservation value. Species composition was highly responsive to management variables compared to diversity components. Conclusions: The combination of sheep and cattle grazing at various stocking rates is an effective tool to preserve the diversity of plant species and communities within a region with a long tradition of livestock management, through the scaling up of effects by local processes occurring in patches at smaller scales.

* We recorded phenotypic differences in leaf and root mass fractions ({LMF}, {RMF}), specific leaf area ({SLA}) and specific root length ({SRL}) of 12 herbaceous species grown in factorial combinations of high/low irradiance and fertilization treatments.


* Leaf area and root length ratios, and their components, were influenced by nonadditive effects between light and nutrient supply, and differences in the strength of plant responses were partly explained by Ellenberg's species values representing ecological optima. Changes in allocation were critical in plant responses to nutrient availability, as the {RMF} contribution to changes in root length was 2.5× that of the {SRL}. Contrastingly, morphological adjustments ({SLA} rather than {LMF}) made up the bulk of plant response to light availability.


* Our results suggest largely predictable differences in responses of species and groups of species to environmental change. Nevertheless, they stress the critical need to account for adjustments in below-ground mass allocation to understand the assembly and responses of communities in changing environments.},

First, niche separation analysis was performed to relate species' niche positions/breadths with bioclimatic gradients. These gradients of aridity, seasonality of water availability, heat, and cold stress explained almost all variation in niche distributions. Species present in zones of extreme aridity or temperature exhibited narrower niche breadths than species situated in moderate sites, suggesting that stress-tolerant species do not occupy broad environmental ranges. Second, species niche positions were related to selected biological traits. Species of arid sites had significantly lower blade areas than did species of moist sites, confirming a functional trade-off between stress tolerance and productivity for leaf design. Species dispersal mode was correlated to species niche positions on the aridity gradient, suggesting allometrically determined correlations between leaf design and the design of reproductive structures. Species niche positions were also correlated with flowering traits, with species that initiate flowering in winter found under Mediterranean climate influence and species that initiate flowering in spring in sites with greater summer rainfall input. By interrelating species niche positions on bioclimatic gradients with selected biological traits, we explored a novel biogeographical approach to understanding species distributions.},

However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary.
* 2We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters.
* 3To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability.
* 4We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes.
* 5This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

	abstract = {1. Intraspecific trait variability is a crucial, often neglected, component of functional diversity ({FD}) in ecological communities. In particular, uncertainty remains as to the importance of intraspecific variability in the quantification of {FD}. 2. To explore this uncertainty, we propose two methods addressing two critical and complementary, but largely unexplored, questions: (i) what is the extent of within- vs. between-species {FD} in different communities? and (ii) to what extent is the response of {FD} to environment because of compositional turnover vs. intraspecific trait variability across habitats? The methods proposed to address these questions are built on a variance partitioning approach and have the advantage of including species relative abundance, therefore taking into account species dominance and rarity. For each of the questions, we illustrate one dedicated case study in semi-natural grasslands with associated sampling strategies. 3. The decomposition of total community variance into within- vs. between-species effects can be implemented in a manner similar to the decomposition of quadratic entropy on pairwise individual dissimilarity. The approach can be applied with single and multiple traits, although it proves more informative for single traits. It can prove particularly useful when assessing the role of different sources of trait variability in the assembly of communities. 4. The assessment of the relative contribution of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover to the response of {FD} to environment is based on a variance partitioning comparing {FD} indices computed (i) either using individuals measured in a specific habitat alone ({FDhabitat}) or (ii) all individuals measured across different habitats ({FDfixed}). This approach provides a more complete understanding of the response of {FD} to environment. 5. We further propose a guide to apply these two methods and to choose the most suitable method for intraspecific trait measurements. Assessing the role of intraspecific trait variability should allow a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that link species and ecosystems.},

Seed production (inversely related to seed size) and recruitment success (positively related) affect colonization ability, suggesting that seed size can be used as a key trait. 2 Data on seed size, dispersal mode, life form, geographical range size and abundance were gathered for 81 grassland plant species in a field study area in Sweden. Seed production and plant size were estimated for 69 of these species. Analyses were performed both across species, with species treated as independent data points, and for 43 `phylogenetically independent contrasts'. 3 The cross-species analyses suggested that local abundance was related to life forms but not dispersal or plant size. Perennials were generally most abundant, as were clonal species. If abundance reflects colonization we predicted that species with intermediately sized seeds (or intermediate seed production) would be most abundant, and this was supported by the phylogenetic contrast but not by cross-species analyses. In the former analysis, a high abundance of species was significantly associated with a small seed size deviation (and seed number deviation) from the median values of these traits in the community. 4 Local abundance, seed production and seed size deviation from the community median value were positively related to geographical range size in the cross-species analysis, but no relationships were seen in the phylogenetic contrast analysis. 5 We conclude that colonization processes do have a significant influence on abundance patterns in grasslands. Seed size is a key trait for colonizing ability, and the effects of the trade-off of seed size vs. seed number must be considered. No single mechanism can be identified that influences both abundance and geographical distribution range.},

	abstract = {1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories - dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A `mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Understanding and forecasting changes in plant communities, ecosystem properties, and their associated services requires a mechanistic link between community shifts and modifications in ecosystem properties. In this study, we test the hypothesis that plant traits can provide such a link. Using subalpine grasslands in the central French Alps as a case study, we investigate the response of plant traits to changes in soil resource availability and disturbance regimes associated with changing grassland management as well as the effects of changes in plant traits on measured ecosystem properties. We found that fertilization leads to greater specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content which leads to greater productivity and faster litter decomposition, and that grazing leads to higher leaf toughness and leaf dry matter content which leads to lower productivity and slower decomposition compared to mowing. A state and transition model was used as a flexible conceptual tool for integrating data on community composition, plant traits, and ecosystem properties in the context of management-mediated successional dynamics in subalpine grasslands. Focusing on the biology driving the transition between grassland states, we incorporated plant traits into the formulation of a state and transition model and demonstrated how they could be used to provide a mechanistic link between community shifts and ecosystem properties under complex management regimes with strong land-use legacies.},

	abstract = {* 1Experimental studies have provided significant knowledge of how biodiversity can influence ecosystem processes. However, there is a growing need to relate these findings to natural communities.
* 2Here we identify two major hypotheses for how communities may influence ecosystem processes: the ‘diversity hypothesis’ (the diversity of organisms in a community influences ecosystem processes through mechanisms such as complementary resource use), and the ‘mass ratio hypothesis’ (ecosystem processes are determined overwhelmingly by the functional traits of the dominant species). We then test which of these two hypotheses best explain variation in ecosystem properties and processes (biomass pools and fluxes, water use, light interception) in a temperate native grassland. We do this by applying various measures of diversity, functional diversity, and functional identity, whose significant relations with ecosystem processes would support either of the competing hypotheses.
* 3Mean trait values best explained variation in five of the eight ecosystem processes examined, supporting Grime's mass ratio hypothesis, which proposes that the functional identities of the dominant species largely determine ecosystem processes.
* 4Multi-trait functional diversity indices also explained large amounts of variation in ecosystem processes, while only weak relationships were observed between species richness and ecosystem processes.
* 5To explore the mechanistic interactions between variables, we developed structural equation models ({SEMs}), which indicated that many of the community diversity and trait properties significantly influenced ecosystem processes, even after accounting for co-varying biotic/abiotic factors.
* 6Synthesis. Our study is one of the first explicit comparisons of the ‘diversity’ and ‘mass ratio’ hypotheses, and our results most strongly support the mass ratio hypothesis, that is, the traits of the dominant species most influenced the ecosystem properties and processes examined. Our results suggest that the management of communities for the maintenance of ecosystem processes should focus on species dominance hierarchies.},

	abstract = {1. Ecosystem services ({ES}) lie at the core of the interactions among humans and ecosystems. Fundamental understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying the simultaneous provision of multiple {ES} has been lagging behind policy and management needs and stands out as a research priority. In this paper, we focus on interactions between {ES} resulting from fundamental functional mechanisms. 2. Plant diversity contributes significantly to the delivery of {ES}. Specifically, functional composition strongly determines different ecosystem properties and services. Knowledge on associations and trade-offs among different plant traits is well established, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and the resulting ability for ecosystems to provide multiple services have only started to be explored. We present a conceptual framework linking environmental change to changes in ecosystem functioning and to changes in {ES} through plant traits. We explicitly consider the leaf economics and size axes of plant functional variation, and how their responses to key environmental variables are expected to scale-up to ecosystem properties and {ES}. 3. The framework was tested using a structural equation modelling formalism to understand the trait-based mechanisms driving trade-offs in {ES} in mountain grasslands. Variations along the leaf economics spectrum ({LES}) towards more exploitative strategies in response to increasing fertility led to a combined increase in several {ES} valued by local stakeholders, including agronomic value, cultural value and soil water retention. Surprisingly, and contrary to published hypotheses, soil carbon sequestration in the studied subalpine system did not increase at lower fertility which was associated with more conservative plant strategies. Independent variation in {LES} and height provided alternative pathways to biomass production. 4. Synthesis: A trait-based framework can support the understanding and aid the management of multiple {ES}. We recommend testing this framework in a variety of contexts and at larger scales, using additional trait axes such as wood density or seed size.},

	abstract = {Plant strategies for using available resources were explored through a comparative analysis of C allocation and use in the rhizosphere. The seasonal dynamics of plant C partitioning was compared for annual and perennial species of bromegrass (Bromus madritensis and B. erectus) in soils of different fertility using successive 2-week labelling with 14CO2. Measurements of labelled soil {CO}2 indicated that current assimilates were readily used by roots and rhizosphere microflora. For vegetative stages of plant growth, there was a regular decrease during the year of carbon translocation from above to below-ground and 10–20\% more of net C assimilation was directed toward the roots in the poor soil than in the fertile soil. During reproductive stages, there were drastic decreases to as low as 10 and 25\% of net C assimilation reaching below-ground in the annual and perennial species, respectively. Over an entire year, below-ground C allocation in B. madritensis was 37\% of net assimilation in the fertile soil and 44\% in the poor soil. In B. erectus the figures varied from 42-49 to 60\% in the fertile and poor soil, respectively. The proportion of current below-ground C respired and exuded in the rhizosphere was more than 15\% higher in the fertile soil than in the poor soil. During reproductive stages, C losses exceeded gain by the roots and the variation from vegetative to reproductive stages reached 30\% in B. madritensis (25–57\% in poor soil, 45–73\% in fertile soil), 20\% in B. erectus (39–59\% for plants developed from cuttings in the rich soil). In B. erectus, the development of reproductive structures was strongly correlated with soil fertility and a determinant in rhizosphere C budgets. This feature characterised the difference between the annual and perennial species. When expressed in units of C translocated below-ground per unit of root C, the highest C use efficiency was in the poor soil. In B. madritensis, 64\% of annual below-ground C allocation remained in the roots in the poor soil, 44\% in the fertile soil. In B. erectus, this percentage varied from 62 to 50\% between low and high fertility soils. The trade-off between rate of growth and resource use efficiency defined in the literature for above ground plant traits was confirmed below-ground: faster growth rate, higher losses and, therefore, lower resource use efficiency in the rich soil than in the poor soil.},

	abstract = {Despite their wide range of applications, process-based plant (crop and grassland) growth models often fail to reproduce yields, particularly at farm, regional and larger scales. This is largely due to inadequate information about field management activities needed as input to these models. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to link plant growth models with farm management models which allow the simulation of management activities considering farmers’ aims and constraints. Different approaches to model farm management are available, but tangible results to justify the choice for a specific approach are lacking. The objective of this work was to compare the effects of different approaches of modelling farm management on the simulation of grassland mechanized harvest dates and yields. Simulations were run with each approach for two grassland-based beef farms and 3 years and compared with available data over 156 harvest events. Our results show significant differences in the accuracy of simulated harvest dates depending on the approach to model farm management. Approaches using fixed dates or optimal phenological stages determined by expert knowledge performed less accurate than the one using calibrated phenological stages. Best results were achieved with a detailed farm management model. The accuracy of simulated yields was less affected by the chosen farm management modelling approach. However, this differed depending on the climate and the timing of harvest, allowing to rank approaches according to their ability to simulate harvest dates and yields. We conclude that further investigation is required to generalize these findings to other farm types including arable farming, and to support the analysis, modelling and calibration of farmers’ management decision processes.},

	abstract = {The ability to design plant communities to optimize particular ecosystem functions and thus more effectively provide ecosystem services would improve all types of ecosystem management, including agriculture. We propose a novel quantitative multi-step method for selecting mixtures of plant species to meet ecosystem objectives: collecting trait data; identifying suites of traits related to relevant community processes; relating those processes to the ecosystem functions of interest; optimizing the planted mixture; and evaluating trade-offs. This approach was tested using planted mixtures of 14 grassland species common in managed pastures of the northeastern United States. Ordination of trait data from greenhouse and small plot studies was used to relate species traits to community processes, followed by generalized additive modeling to relate community-weighted mean process scores to field estimates of biomass production and resistance to invasion. Multi-criteria optimization identified seed mixtures that maximized or minimized selected ecosystem functions, facilitating quantification of trade-offs in processual ability within species and between ecosystem functions at the community level. In this study, predicted seasonal and annual biomass values were within expected ranges, but the optimal mixtures differed from forage mixtures traditionally planted in the northeastern United States. Perennial ryegrass was the most commonly-selected grass. Legumes were represented less than expected, possibly due to attributes such as longevity and forage quality that are important in pastures but were not directly included in the optimization. Ecosystem function was not linearly related to species richness. While further research on quantitatively relating species traits and community processes is needed, multi-criteria optimization offers a new path for linking ecosystem function to ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food.},

In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions ({TMI}) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about {TMI} among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints, new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity.

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem stability and the maintenance of optimal ecosystem functionality. Conservation measures are thus essential to safeguard the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides and human society needs. Current anthropogenic threats may lead to detrimental (and perhaps irreversible) ecosystem degradation, providing strong motivation to evaluate the response of ecological communities to various anthropogenic pressures. In particular, ecosystem functions that sustain key ecosystem services should be identified and prioritized for conservation action. Traditional diversity measures (e.g. ‘species richness’) may not adequately capture the aspects of biodiversity most relevant to ecosystem stability and functionality, but several new concepts may be more appropriate. These include ‘response diversity’, describing the variation of responses to environmental change among species of a particular community. Response diversity may also be a key determinant of ecosystem resilience in the face of anthropogenic pressures and environmental uncertainty. However, current understanding of response diversity is poor, and we see an urgent need to disentangle the conceptual strands that pervade studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our review clarifies the links between response diversity and the maintenance of ecosystem functionality by focusing on the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity and the concept of functional redundancy. We provide a conceptual model to describe how loss of response diversity may cause ecosystem degradation through decreased ecosystem resilience. We explicitly explain how response diversity contributes to functional compensation and to spatio-temporal complementarity among species, leading to long-term maintenance of ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent quantitative studies suggest that traditional diversity measures may often be uncoupled from measures (such as response diversity) that may be more effective proxies for ecosystem stability and resilience. Certain conclusions and recommendations of earlier studies using these traditional measures as indicators of ecosystem resilience thus may be suspect. We believe that functional ecology perspectives incorporating the effects and responses of diversity are essential for development of management strategies to safeguard (and restore) optimal ecosystem functionality (especially multifunctionality). Our review highlights these issues and we envision our work generating debate around the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functionality, and leading to improved conservation priorities and biodiversity management practices that maximize ecosystem resilience in the face of uncertain environmental change.},

This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change.

	abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

	abstract = {Extreme drought events can dramatically impact grassland ecosystems, causing potential loss of forage production for livestock in temperate grasslands. However, knowledge of drought effects on forage production, nutritive value and plant community stability in the real context of farming management is scarce. For this purpose, the effect of a simulated summer drought was studied under two realistic management types on a semi-natural grassland in the Swiss Jura mountains. The first management (“grazing”) consisted in six consecutive utilizations by animals over the growing season, representing a rotational grazing system as regionally conducted. The second management (“mowing”) consisted of three harvests, corresponding to the usual mowing frequency of hay meadows. In both managements, drought caused minor short-term modifications of species composition and almost no persistent effects were observed. Besides, important short-term changes were observed in community weighted mean of several key functional traits, reflecting a strong decline in community growth during the drought followed by a partial recovery two months later. Forage yields, and to a lesser extent its nutritive value, thus declined during the drought period. Both were still affected in the following months, but had recovered in spring of the following year. Forage loss was twofold higher in the grazing management, but recovery as well as nutritive value was slightly improved in this management. The results suggest that rotational grazing can amplify negative drought impacts, compared to traditional mowing, and highlight the need to adapt such management in dry years. They also demonstrate that, even under a fairly intensive management, resilience of such mountain grasslands after one extreme drought event can be expected to be high, with no persistent changes in species and trait compositions.},

We examined the effects of variation and uncertainty on selection for plasticity using an individual-based computer simulation model. In the model, the environment consisted of a linear gradient of 50 demes with dispersal occurring either before or after selection. Individuals consisted of multiple loci whose phenotypic expression either are affected (plastic) or are not affected (nonplastic) by the environment. Typically, evolution occurred first as genetic differentiation, which was then replaced by the evolution of adaptive plasticity, opposite to the evolutionary trend that is often assumed. Increasing dispersal rates selected for plasticity, if selection occurred before dispersal. If selection occurred after dispersal, the highest plasticity was at intermediate dispersal rates. Temporal variation in the environment occurring after development, but before selection, favored the evolution of plasticity. With dispersal before selection, such temporal variation resulted in hyperplasticity, with a reaction norm much steeper than the optimum. This effect was enhanced with negative temporal autocorrelation and can be interpreted as representing a form of bet hedging. As the number of nonplastic loci increased, plasticity was disfavored due to an increase in the uncertainty of the genomic environment. This effect was reversed with temporal variation. Thus, variation and uncertainty affect whether or not plasticity is favored with different sources of variation—arising from the amount and timing of dispersal, from temporal variation, and even from the genetic architecture underlying the phenotype—having contrasting, interacting, and at times unexpected effects.},

	abstract = {In a spatially heterogeneous environment, the rate at which individuals move among habitats affects whether selection favors phenotypic plasticity or genetic differentiation, with high dispersal rates favoring trait plasticity. Until now, in theoretical explorations of plasticity evolution, dispersal rate has been treated as a fixed, albeit probabilistic, characteristic of a population, raising the question of what happens when the propensity to disperse and trait plasticity are allowed to evolve jointly. We examined the effects of their joint evolution on selection for plasticity using an individual-based computer simulation model. In the model, the environment consisted of a linear gradient of 50 demes with dispersal occurring either before or after selection. Individuals consisted of loci whose phenotypic expression either are affected by the environment (plastic) or are not affected (nonplastic), plus a locus determining the propensity to disperse. When dispersal rate and trait plasticity evolve jointly, the system tends to dichotomous outcomes of either high trait plasticity and high dispersal, or low trait plasticity and low dispersal. The outcome strongly depended on starting conditions, with high trait plasticity and dispersal favored when the system started at high values for either trait plasticity or dispersal rate (or both). Adding a cost of plasticity tended to drive the system to genetic differentiation, although this effect also depended on initial conditions. Genetic linkage between trait plasticity loci and dispersal loci further enhanced this strong dichotomy in evolutionary outcomes. All of these effects depended on organismal life history pattern, and in particular whether selection occurred before or after dispersal. These results can explain why adaptive trait plasticity is less common than might be expected.},

	abstract = {To understand empirical patterns of phenotypic plasticity, we need to explore the complexities of environmental heterogeneity and how it interacts with cue reliability. I consider both temporal and spatial variation separately and in combination, the timing of temporal variation relative to development, the timing of movement relative to selection, and two different patterns of movement: stepping-stone and island. Among-generation temporal heterogeneity favors plasticity, while within-generation heterogeneity can result in cue unreliability. In general, spatial variation more strongly favors plasticity than temporal variation, and island migration more strongly favors plasticity than stepping-stone migration. Negative correlations among environments between the time of development and selection can result in seemingly maladaptive reaction norms. The effects of higher dispersal rates depend on the life history stage when dispersal occurs and the pattern of environmental heterogeneity. Thus, patterns of environmental heterogeneity can be complex and can interact in unforeseen ways to affect cue reliability. Proper interpretation of patterns of trait plasticity requires consideration of the ecology and biology of the organism. More information on actual cue reliability and the ecological and developmental context of trait plasticity is needed.},

In the general case of clonal replicates or full-sibs raised in several environments, the heritability of plasticity can be measured as the ratio of the genotype-environment interaction variance to the total phenotypic variance. In the special case of only two environments plasticity also can be measured as the difference among environments in genotype or family means. In that case, the heritability of plasticity can be measured as either a ratio of variance components or as the slope of a parent-offspring regression. The general measure suffers because no least-square standard errors have been developed, although they can be calculated by maximum-likelihood or bootstrapping techniques. For the other two methods least-square standard errors can be calculated but require very large experiments for statistical significance to be achieved. The heritability measures are compared using data on plasticity of thorax size in response to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster. The heritability estimates are all in close agreement. Models of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity have treated it as a trait in its own right and as a cross-environment genetic correlation.

	abstract = {The phenotypic plasticity of axial root anatomy was investigated in response to the availability of above- and below-ground resources using eight grass species of the genera Bromus and Poa. In a 7-week garden experiment nutrients were varied by a factor of five and light treatments of 100, 30 and 5·5\% daylight were applied. Both nutrients and light influenced root structure. The effect of nutrients was largely explained by plant size, but this was not the case for light. Shading to 30\% daylight led to a higher proportion of stele, larger stelar cells and larger xylem vessels. This can be understood either as an increased need for high transport capacity in the shade, where leaf area is larger but root mass lower than in full daylight, or as an increased resistance against desiccation, which is more of a hazard in open sites. Under 5·5\% daylight, tissue mass density was reduced due to a lower proportion of stele, though xylem characteristics were not influenced when a correction for the effect of root cross-sectional area was applied. This response may be interpreted as a mechanism to maintain root function with a lower investment in biomass when growth is limited by low irradiance. The results show that the response of a plant to resource limitation is not restricted to those organs responsible for the acquisition of that resource. Furthermore, the qualitative response to shading depends on the absolute level of irradiance. For this reason, care is needed when comparing the results of shading experiments conducted under different irradiances. Copyright 2001 Annals of Botany Company},

Phenotypic plasticity is considered one of the major means by which plants can cope with environmental factor variability. Nevertheless, the extent to which phenotypic plasticity may facilitate survival under environmental condition changes still remains largely unknown because results are sometimes controversial. Thus, it is important to identify plant functional traits in which plasticity may play a determinant role in plant response to global change as well as on the ecological consequences at an ecosystem level for the competition between wild and invasive species, considering that species with a greater adaptive plasticity may be more likely to survive in novel environmental conditions. In the near future, it will be important to increase long-term studies on natural populations in order to understand plant response to environmental factor fluctuations including climate change. There is the necessity to analyze variations at phenotypic and genetic levels for the same species and, in particular, for endemic and rare species because these could have drastic effects at an ecosystem level.},

	abstract = {An ongoing new synthesis in evolutionary theory is expanding our view of the sources of heritable variation beyond point mutations of fixed phenotypic effects to include environmentally sensitive changes in gene regulation. This expansion of the paradigm is necessary given ample evidence for a heritable ability to alter gene expression in response to environmental cues. In consequence, single genotypes are often capable of adaptively expressing different phenotypes in different environments, i.e. are adaptively plastic. We present an individual-based heuristic model to compare the adaptive dynamics of populations composed of plastic or non-plastic genotypes under a wide range of scenarios where we modify environmental variation, mutation rate and costs of plasticity. The model shows that adaptive plasticity contributes to the maintenance of genetic variation within populations, reduces bottlenecks when facing rapid environmental changes and confers an overall faster rate of adaptation. In fluctuating environments, plasticity is favoured by selection and maintained in the population. However, if the environment stabilizes and costs of plasticity are high, plasticity is reduced by selection, leading to genetic assimilation, which could result in species diversification. More broadly, our model shows that adaptive plasticity is a common consequence of selection under environmental heterogeneity, and hence a potentially common phenomenon in nature. Thus, taking adaptive plasticity into account substantially extends our view of adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {In this study, we used data from temperate grassland plant communities in Alberta, Canada to test two longstanding hypotheses in ecology: 1) that there has been correlated evolution of the leaves and roots of plants due to selection for an integrated whole-plant resource uptake strategy, and 2) that trait diversity in ecological communities is generated by adaptations to the conditions in different habitats. We tested the first hypothesis using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for evidence of correlated evolution of suites of leaf and root functional traits in these grasslands. There were consistent evolutionary correlations among traits related to plant resource uptake strategies within leaf tissues, and within root tissues. In contrast, there were inconsistent correlations between the traits of leaves and the traits of roots, suggesting different evolutionary pressures on the above and belowground components of plant morphology. To test the second hypothesis, we evaluated the relative importance of two components of trait diversity: within-community variation (species trait values relative to co-occurring species; α traits) and among-community variation (the average trait value in communities where species occur; β traits). Trait diversity was mostly explained by variation among co-occurring species, not among-communities. Additionally, there was a phylogenetic signal in the within-community trait values of species relative to co-occurring taxa, but not in their habitat associations or among-community trait variation. These results suggest that sorting of pre-existing trait variation into local communities can explain the leaf and root trait diversity in these grasslands.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimates of future climate change in the Alps are relevant for large parts of the European society. At the same time, the complex Alpine region poses considerable challenges to climate models, which translate to uncertainties in the climate projections. Against this background, the present study reviews the state-of-knowledge about 21st century climate change in the Alps based on existing literature and additional analyses. In particular, it explicitly considers the reliability and uncertainty of climate projections.

Results show that besides Alpine temperatures, also precipitation, global radiation, relative humidity, and closely related impacts like floods, droughts, snow cover, and natural hazards will be affected by global warming.

Under the A1B emission scenario, about 0.25 °C warming per decade until the mid of the 21st century and accelerated 0.36 °C warming per decade in the second half of the century is expected. Warming will probably be associated with changes in the seasonality of precipitation, global radiation, and relative humidity, and more intense precipitation extremes and flooding potential in the colder part of the year. The conditions of currently record breaking warm or hot winter or summer seasons, respectively, may become normal at the end of the 21st century, and there is indication for droughts to become more severe in the future. Snow cover is expected to drastically decrease below 1500–2000 m and natural hazards related to glacier and permafrost retreat are expected to become more frequent.

Such changes in climatic parameters and related quantities will have considerable impact on ecosystems and society and will challenge their adaptive capabilities.},

Our aim was to investigate whether interspecific variation in the potential decomposition rate of fine roots could be accounted for by root chemical and morphological traits, life history and taxonomic affiliation. We also investigated the co-ordinated variation in root and leaf traits and potential decomposition rates.
Methods We analysed potential decomposition rates and the chemical and morphological traits of fine roots on 18 Mediterranean herbaceous species grown in controlled conditions. The results were compared with those obtained for leaves in a previous study conducted on similar species.
Key Results Differences in the potential decomposition rates of fine roots between species were accounted for by root chemical composition, but not by morphological traits. The root potential decomposition rate varied with taxonomy, but not with life history. Poaceae, with high cellulose concentration and low concentrations of soluble compounds and phosphorus, decomposed more slowly than Asteraceae and Fabaceae. Patterns of root traits, including decomposition rate, mirrored those of leaf traits, resulting in a similar species clustering.
Conclusions The highly co-ordinated variation of roots and leaves in terms of traits and potential decomposition rate suggests that changes in the functional composition of communities in response to anthropogenic changes will strongly affect biogeochemical cycles at the ecosystem level.},

	abstract = {* There is a fundamental trade-off between leaf traits associated with either resource acquisition or resource conservation. This gradient of trait variation, called the economics spectrum, also applies to fine roots, but whether it is consistent for coarse roots or at the plant community level remains untested.


* We measured a set of morphological and chemical root traits at a community level (functional parameters; {FP}) in 20 plant communities located along land-use intensity gradients and across three climatic zones (tropical, mediterranean and montane). We hypothesized (i) the existence of a root economics spectrum in plant communities consistent within root types (fine, {\textless} 2 mm; coarse, 2–5 mm), (ii) that variations in root {FP} occur with soil depths (top 20 cm of soil and 100–150 cm deep) and (iii) along land-use gradients.


* Root {FP} covaried, in line with the resource acquisition–conservation trade-off, from communities with root {FP} associated with resource acquisition (e.g. high specific root length, {SRL}; thin diameters and low root dry matter contents, {RDMC}) to root {FP} associated with resource conservation (e.g. low {SRL}, thick diameters and high {RDMC}). This pattern was consistent for both fine and coarse roots indicating a strong consistency of a trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation for plant roots.


* Roots had different suites of traits at different depths, suggesting a disparity in root function and exploitation capacities. Shallow, fine roots were thinner, richer in nitrogen and with lower lignin concentrations associated with greater exploitation capacities compared to deep, fine roots. Shallow, coarse roots were richer in nitrogen, carbon and soluble concentrations than deep, coarse roots.


* Fine root parameters of highly disturbed, herbaceous-dominated plant communities in poorer soils were associated with foraging strategies, that is greater {SRL} and lower {RDMC} and lignin concentration than those from less disturbed communities. Coarse roots, however, were less sensitive to the land-use gradient.


* Synthesis. This study demonstrates the existence of a general trade-off in root construction at a community level, which operates within all root types, suggesting that all plant tissues are controlled by the trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation.},

•
Although linkages of leaf and whole-plant traits to leaf lifespan have been rigorously investigated, there is a limited understanding of similar linkages of whole-plant and fine root traits to root lifespan. In comparisons across species, do suites of traits found in leaves also exist for roots, and can these traits be used to predict root lifespan?


*
•
We observed the fine root lifespan of 12 temperate tree species using minirhizotrons in a common garden and compared their median lifespans with fine-root and whole-plant traits. We then determined which set of combined traits would be most useful in predicting patterns of root lifespan.


*
•
Median root lifespan ranged widely among species (95–336 d). Root diameter, calcium content, and tree wood density were positively related to root lifespan, whereas specific root length, nitrogen (N) : carbon (C) ratio, and plant growth rate were negatively related to root lifespan. Root diameter and plant growth rate, together (R2 = 0.62) or in combination with root N : C ratio (R2 = 0.76), were useful predictors of root lifespan across the 12 species.


*
•
Our results highlight linkages between fine root lifespan in temperate trees and plant functional traits that may reduce uncertainty in predictions of root lifespan or turnover across species at broader spatial scales.},

	abstract = {An enduring challenge in ecology is to understand how diverse plant species coexist when competing for the same basic resources. Two candidate frameworks for meeting this challenge currently exist in forest ecology. Niche-based approaches succeed in describing successional dynamics in response to recurrent disturbances. Approaches based on Hubbell's neutral theory describe abundance patterns in highly diverse communities. Yet both theories are unsuccessful where their competitor is strong, highlighting an enduring need for reconciliation. In fact, the perception that niche and neutral processes are incompatible may have arisen because both types of models have lacked some critical features of real forests. Here we report a productive reconciliation that arises from extending niche models to include three ubiquitous features of vegetation: (1) plant growth under light competition, (2) multiple trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function, and (3) evolutionary community assembly. We show that fitness equivalence – which neutral theory controversially takes as an assumption – naturally arises as a mechanistic outcome of niche differentiation, but only within a specific region of trait space, corresponding to shade-tolerant later-successional strategies. In this way, niche diversification can lead, via evolved neutrality, to a proliferation of shade-tolerant strategies, one of the phenomena that motivated the development of neutral theory. Earlier niche models focussed on a single growth-mortality trait and found no evolved neutrality. In contrast, the model introduced here includes a second trait, height at maturation, in addition to a growth-mortality trait in the form of leaf-construction cost. We show that fitness equivalence only emerges when diversifications include this second trait. We also demonstrate that our extended niche model generates markedly different forest types under different environmental conditions, recovering known biogeographic patterns. By evolving forests from first principles, our study constructively resolves the protracted debate about niche versus neutral dynamics for forest communities, and provides a platform for a synthetic theory of forest structure and diversity.},

	abstract = {The responses of photosynthesis, transpiration and leaf conductance to changes in vapour pressure deficit were followed in well-watered plants of the herbaceous species, Helianthus annuus, Helianthus nuttallii, Pisum sativum and Vigna unguiculata, and in the woody species having either sclerophyllous leaves, Arbutus unedo, Nerium oleander and Pistacia vera, or mesomorphic leaves, Corylus avellana, Gossypium hirsutum and Prunus dulcis. When the vapour pressure deficit of the air around a single leaf in a cuvette was varied from 10 to 30 Pa {kPa}-1 in 5 Pa {kPa}-1 steps, while holding the remainder of the plant at a vapour presure deficit of 10 Pa {kPa}-1, the leaf conductance and net photosynthetic rate of the leaf decreased in all species. The rate of transpiration increased initially with increase in vapour pressure deficit in all species, but in several species a maximum transpiration rate was observed at 20 to 25 Pa {kPa}-1. Concurrent measurements of the leaf water potential by in situ psychrometry showed that an increase in the vapour pressure deficit decreased the leaf water potential in all species. The decrease was greatest in woody species, and least in herbaceous species. When the vapour pressure deficit around the remainder of the plant was increased while the leaf in the cuvette was exposed to a low and constant vapour pressure deficit, similar responses in both degree and magnitude in the rates of transpiration and leaf conductance were observed in the remainder of the plant as those occurring when the vapour pressure deficit around the single leaf was varied. Increasing the external vapour pressure deficit lowered the water potential of the leaf in the cuvette in the woody species and induced a decrease in leaf conductance in some, but not all, speies. The decrease in leaf conductance with decreasing water potential was greater in the woody species when the vapour pressure deficit was increased than when it remained low and constant, indicating that changing the leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference had a direct effect on the stomata in these species. The low hydraulic resistance and maintenance of a high leaf water potential precluded such an analysis in the herbaceous species. We conclude that at least in the woody species studied, an increase in the vapour pressure deficit around a leaf will decrease leaf gas exchange through a direct effect on the leaf epidermis and sometimes additionally through a lowering of the mesophyll water potential.},

	abstract = {* 1Increasing functional diversity often leads to an increase in ecosystem productivity in the form of overyielding. While the mechanisms (i.e. complementarity or facilitation) that underlie overyielding provide strong insights into species coexistence and community assembly, they are rarely tested. In subalpine grasslands, traditional management through manuring and hay-making results in intermediate productivity that is associated with high functional diversity. This functional diversity results from the coexistence between conservative plant species (with slow growth rates, low specific leaf area) and exploitative species (with fast growth rates, high specific leaf area).
* 2We hypothesized that overyielding occurs among these two functional groups and tested whether complementarity or facilitation can explain overyielding. Using three perennial grass species per functional group, we compared single and mixed functional group mesocosms at low and intermediate levels of fertilization to test the occurrence of overyielding. Additionally, we measured the outcomes of biotic interactions among these two functional groups by manipulating plant density.
* 3After two growing seasons, we found evidence of overyielding under intermediate levels of fertility. Overyielding was associated with a reduction of competition intensity when both functional groups were grown together. These results suggest that complementarity, as evidenced by a decrease in competition intensity, rather than facilitation, explains the observed overyielding. Indeed, we found evidence for complementarity for light and modification of nutrient use as possible mechanisms for the overyielding.
* 4Synthesis. Complementarity between functional groups might be an important mechanism enhancing functional diversity, particularly in harsh environments at intermediate rather than low fertility.},

	abstract = {Positive interactions are hypothesized to increase with stress (stress-gradient hypothesis, “{SGH}”), which is defined in terms of standing biomass at the community level. However, recent evidence suggests that facilitation may decrease or remain constant as stress increases. Several reasons for this discrepancy are possible: (i) the outcomes of biotic interactions depend on the component of the fitness considered; (ii) they are influenced by how vegetation affects local limiting resources; (iii) within a particular community, only species that are deviated from their physiological optima are likely to be facilitated. In a removal experiment, we quantified the deviations of species in subalpine grassland from their physiological optima, defined here as species-level “strain”, and examined whether strain and vegetation effects on local resources can explain the outcome of biotic interactions. The experiment was performed along a gradient of standing biomass driven by contrasting land use and resource availability, and used five grass species with contrasting traits and ecological optima. Strain for each species was estimated by comparing growth without vegetation (target species only submitted to local abiotic factors) to growth in optimal conditions (under controlled conditions in an experimental garden). The outcomes of biotic interactions, recorded in terms of survival and growth, could be predicted from the data about strain and vegetation effects on local limiting resources (light and water). Only highly strained species were affected by facilitation, which occurred when the surrounding vegetation alleviated the constraining factors. On the other hand, standing biomass was poorly related with the outcomes of biotic interactions. The “{SGH}” was only partially validated with growth data when strain and vegetation effects co-varied with standing biomass. As a consequence, strain (at species level) represents a mechanistic basis which could improve the prediction of the outcomes of biotic interactions along ecological gradients.},

To evaluate the importance of biotic interactions in shaping plant communities, it is necessary to understand how the outcomes of the complex interactions observed at the individual level can influence community structure. 2.  Here, we propose a trait-based framework that identifies and organises mechanisms affecting community structure (here described with relative abundances of plant functional traits – i.e. the distribution of trait values at the community level). We applied our approach to a single leaf trait, specific leaf area ({SLA}), to link individual responses to plant interactions with community structure ({SLA} distribution observed at the community level) and to test whether biotic interactions can predict the functional composition of subalpine grasslands. We evaluated the generality of our model through a cross-validation with a set of eight subalpine grasslands independent from the four fields used to build the model. 3.  We found that competition and facilitation were able to explain the functional composition of subalpine grasslands, and the relevant fitness components (survival or growth) explaining this link changed depending on the limiting resources. When soil water availability was limiting, positive plant-plant interactions acting on survival were able to explain community structure. In contrast, when no water limitation was observed competition acting on individual growth was the main driver of community structure. 4.  Our framework enables evaluation of the consequences of biotic interactions observed at individual level on community structure, thereby indicating when and where different types of plant-plant interactions are important.},

	abstract = {Aim: More powerful tests of biodiversity theories need to move beyond species richness and explicitly focus on mechanisms generating diversity via trait composition. The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However, a general theory of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature), has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory, it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term ‘Trait Driver Theory’ or {TDT}. It shows that the shape and dynamics of trait and size distributions can be linked to fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of {TDT}, we review several theoretical studies and recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences ecosystem processes across an elevational gradient and a 140-year-long ecological experiment. We show that {TDT} provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then ‘scale up’ to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, {TDT} offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change.},

The direct effect of increasing land-use intensity on decomposition was positive and was associated with increases in nutrient concentrations and current velocities. However, this relationship was countered by negative effects associated with a loss of detritivore functional diversity along the gradient during autumn and shifts in species trait composition during spring, limiting the net change in functioning associated with increasing land-use management overall.

	abstract = {Body size determines key behavioral and life history traits across species, as well as interactions between individuals within and between species. Therefore, variation in sizes of immigrants, by exerting variation in trophic interaction strengths, may drive the trajectory and outcomes of community assembly. Here, I study the effects of size variation in the immigration pool on assembly dynamics and equilibrium distributions of sizes and consumer–resource size-ratios using a general mathematical model. I find that because small sizes both, improve the ability to invade and destabilize the community, invasibility and stability pull body size distributions in opposite directions, favoring an increase in both size and size-ratios during assembly, and ultimately yielding a right-skewed size and a symmetric size-ratio distribution. In many scenarios, the result at equilibrium is a systematic increase in body sizes and size-ratios with trophic level. Thus these patterns in size structure are ‘signatures’ of dynamically constrained, non-neutral community assembly. I also show that for empirically feasible distributions of body sizes in the immigration pool, immigration bias in body sizes cannot counteract dynamical constraints during assembly and thus signatures emerge consistently. I test the theoretical predictions using data from nine terrestrial and aquatic communities and find strong evidence that natural communities do indeed exhibit such signatures of dynamically constrained assembly. Overall, the results provide new measures to detect general, non-neutral patterns in community assembly dynamics, and show that in general, body size is dominant trait that strongly influences assembly and recovery of natural communities and ecosystems.},

Therefore, integrating individual phenotypic variation within a larger ecological framework may provide better insight into how populations structure themselves. Recent evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour prompts the hypothesis that variation in behavioural types might be related to variation in movement in natural environments. In a multiyear mark–recapture study, we found that individual sticklebacks exhibited consistent individual differences in behaviour both within a standardized testing arena designed to measure exploratory behaviour and within a river. Therefore, we asked whether individual differences in movement in a natural river were related to an individual's exploratory behavioural type. We also considered whether body condition and/or the individual's habitat or social environment use was related to movement. There was no evidence that an individual's exploratory behavioural type was related to movement within the river. Instead, an individual's habitat use and body condition interacted to influence natural movement patterns. Individuals in good condition were more likely to move further in the river, but only if they inhabited a vegetated complex part of the river; body condition had no influence on movement in those individuals inhabiting open areas of the river. Our results suggest that individual traits could help improve predictions about how populations may distribute themselves within patchy and complex environments.},

We build an evolutionary model of a plant–pollinator–herbivore community, where both pollinators and herbivores are confronted with the same external disturbance, insecticide use. Pollinators’ and herbivores’ response to disturbances is controlled by a trait (e.g. sensitivity trait) that incurs a cost in reproduction. Using Adaptive Dynamics Theory, we find that herbivore evolution lowers densities of species and may drive pollinators to extinction while pollinator evolution increases densities and enhances community maintenance. We then show that coevolution, by constraining the variability of coevolving species, produces qualitative dynamics that cannot be predicted from the mere addition of single-species evolution scenarios.},

	abstract = {Concerted effort in ecology is focused on developing synthetic frameworks that quantify general trends between diversity of organismal functional traits and ecosystem functioning. Yet much variation about the general trend routinely remains unexplained by trait diversity alone. We argue that this arises because these approaches fail to consider flexibility in trait expression as organisms adaptively respond to different environmental contexts (e.g., changes in resource quality or consumer pressure). We present here a framework for resolving how flexibility in functional trait expression is related to ecosystem functioning. We propose an approach that considers focal species, their resources and their consumers as a modular trophic unit. The approach then examines functional trait expressions of focal species when juxtaposed between different resource species (and associated traits) and consumer species (and associated traits). In such cases, focal species not only directly respond to different resource qualities and consumer pressure, but also mediate the indirect effects of consumer pressure on resource quality, causing feedbacks that ramify through ecosystems. Using case studies, we illustrate the utility of our modular approach for understanding how functional traits determine ecosystem functioning in a variety of aboveground and belowground trophic modules within ecosystems. We offer some general principles for explaining how variation in interactions among species determines variation in ecosystem functioning through a lens of flexible functional traits expression.},

We measured the body size of 24,609 individuals from 313 taxa ranging over 6 orders of magnitude in size to explore how the functional properties of individuals, populations and communities are affected by moisture (aquatic vs. terrestrial) and light (diurnal vs. nocturnal), and how these properties change across the aquatic–terrestrial habitat transition that occurs as the pool bed dried. We found strong effects of moisture on some population (size structure) and many community (species richness, abundance, evenness, biomass and size structure) properties, with additional temporal effects across the aquatic–terrestrial ecotone. There was no difference between diurnal and nocturnal populations or communities. Our results facilitate understanding of how the physical environment influences functional attributes, and particularly the size structure, of natural populations and communities.},

	abstract = {Ecology has traditionally focused on species diversity as a way of characterizing the health of an ecosystem. In recent years, however, the focus has increasingly shifted towards trait diversity both within and across species. As we increasingly recognize that ecological and evolutionary timescales may not be all that different, understanding the ecological effects of trait variation becomes paramount. Trait variation is thus the keystone to our understanding of how evolutionary processes may affect ecological dynamics as they unfold, and how these may in turn alter evolutionary trajectories. However, a multi-level understanding of how trait variation scales up from individuals to whole communities or ecosystems is still a work in progress. The chapters in this volume explore how functional trait diversity affects ecological processes across levels of biological organization. This chapter aims at binding the messages of the different contributions and considers how they advance our understanding of how trait variation can be scaled up to understand the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics from individuals to ecosystems.},

The magnitude of interference is linked to that of attack efficiency: when both levels are intermediate, populations are maximally stable and have high competitive ability. Individual variation can affect ecological dynamics through its effect on attack efficiency and handling time. Because interference has a non-linear effect on consumer foraging rates, individual variation in mutual interference can strongly affect ecological dynamics. Here, we explicitly incorporate individual variation in attack efficiency, handling time and interference into a dynamic consumer–resource model and show that variation increases species coexistence by depressing attack efficiency to a greater extent than predator interference. We argue that this differential effect of variation affects the equilibrium densities of consumers and their prey, thus altering their competitive ability. Intermediate levels of variation can maximize both consumer persistence and competitive ability. Our results show the importance of quantifying individual variation in natural populations for understanding the persistence and stability of species within communities.},

	abstract = {The responses of photosynthesis, transpiration and leaf conductance to changes in vapour pressure deficit were followed in well-watered plants of the herbaceous species, Helianthus annuus, Helianthus nuttallii, Pisum sativum and Vigna unguiculata, and in the woody species having either sclerophyllous leaves, Arbutus unedo, Nerium oleander and Pistacia vera, or mesomorphic leaves, Corylus avellana, Gossypium hirsutum and Prunus dulcis. When the vapour pressure deficit of the air around a single leaf in a cuvette was varied from 10 to 30 Pa {kPa}-1 in 5 Pa {kPa}-1 steps, while holding the remainder of the plant at a vapour presure deficit of 10 Pa {kPa}-1, the leaf conductance and net photosynthetic rate of the leaf decreased in all species. The rate of transpiration increased initially with increase in vapour pressure deficit in all species, but in several species a maximum transpiration rate was observed at 20 to 25 Pa {kPa}-1. Concurrent measurements of the leaf water potential by in situ psychrometry showed that an increase in the vapour pressure deficit decreased the leaf water potential in all species. The decrease was greatest in woody species, and least in herbaceous species. When the vapour pressure deficit around the remainder of the plant was increased while the leaf in the cuvette was exposed to a low and constant vapour pressure deficit, similar responses in both degree and magnitude in the rates of transpiration and leaf conductance were observed in the remainder of the plant as those occurring when the vapour pressure deficit around the single leaf was varied. Increasing the external vapour pressure deficit lowered the water potential of the leaf in the cuvette in the woody species and induced a decrease in leaf conductance in some, but not all, speies. The decrease in leaf conductance with decreasing water potential was greater in the woody species when the vapour pressure deficit was increased than when it remained low and constant, indicating that changing the leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference had a direct effect on the stomata in these species. The low hydraulic resistance and maintenance of a high leaf water potential precluded such an analysis in the herbaceous species. We conclude that at least in the woody species studied, an increase in the vapour pressure deficit around a leaf will decrease leaf gas exchange through a direct effect on the leaf epidermis and sometimes additionally through a lowering of the mesophyll water potential.},

Basal diameters, canopy diameters, and standing plant heights were measured for individual plants. Three models of volume (basal elliptical cylinder, canopy elliptical cylinder, and elliptical cone section) were tested as predictors of plant phytomass using nonlinear regression. Elliptical cone section produced the highest R2 and lowest {SEE}, but requires measurement of canopy diameters which may be subject to excessive measurement error. Basal elliptical cylinder produced R2 and {SEE} values nearly comparable to those of the elliptical cone section; moreover, this model does not require measurement of canopy diameters, making it the practical choice. Nonlinear regressions for plants by size class (small, medium and large) were produced using 1983 data. Predictive ability of size class-specific equations was compared to that of the equation for all size classes combined. When phytomass of only small or medium size class plants was predicted, the {SEE} of size class-specific equations was slightly lower than the {SEE} of the equation for all size classes combined. When phytomass of plants from all size classes was predicted, however, the equation for all size classes combined produced the lowest combined {SEE} for new data (i.e., data not used to generate the equation). There were substantial year-to-year differences between equations, which indicates the necessity of producing new equations each year.},

This causes the leaf light response equation to acclimate continuously to the current conditions of light and N nutrition, which can vary greatly within a crop canopy, and through a growing season, with important consequences for gross production. Predictions are presented for the dynamics of acclimation, acclimated and non-acclimated photosynthetic rates are compared, and the dependence of leaf properties on light and N availability is explored. There is good correspondence of predictions with experimental results at the leaf level. The model also provides a mechanism for a down regulation of photosynthesis in response to increased carbon dioxide concentrations, whose magnitude will depend on conditions, particularly of nitrogen nutrition.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

	abstract = {1. Reproductive biomass ({RB}) is a key component of plant life history. Because {RB} is allometric, it remains unclear whether the observed variations of {RB} in response to land use are driven only by a size dependency effect or if the partitioning of plant biomass may also shift independently of plant size. This question has not been addressed for all the main component species of a given plant community. 2. Here, we report the results of a 3-year experimental study conducted in Tibetan alpine grasslands. The above-ground vegetative biomass ({VB}) and the {RB} of 32 species were measured during 2 years in control, grazed and fertilized plots. We estimated the allometric slope and intercept for 301 {VB}-{RB} bivariates, using type {II} regression analyses in order to disentangle size-dependent and size-independent effects of treatment on {RB}. 3. Our results indicate significant changes in the {VB}-{RB} allometric slope for 26 out of 102 cases in grazed plots, and 16 out of 88 cases in fertilized plots. Moreover, in cases where slopes were not affected by treatment, a significant change in the allometric intercept was found in 50\% of the models. For these cases, intercepts - which are indicative of the biomass invested in reproductive parts for a given {VB} - generally increased in grazed plots and decreased in fertilized plots. 4. Grazing and fertilization triggered a significant decreases or increases in the plant size for species, especially graminoids. However, we found no relationship between changes in allometric coefficients and magnitude of the biomass response. 5. At the interspecific level, the intercept, but not the slope, of the allometric {VB}-{RB} relationships was significantly affected by land use. Graminoids and forbs responded similarly to treatment. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that (i) size-dependent effects did not explain all the changes observed in {RB} following grazing and fertilization in alpine grasslands, and that (ii) changes in allometric intercept explained most of the size-independent variations both at the intra- and interspecific level. We discuss why size-independent changes in {RB} could be important for plant performance in changing environments.},

	abstract = {The subject of this review is the impact of long-term changes in temperature on plant growth and its underlying components. The discussion highlights the extent to which thermal acclimation of metabolism is intrinsically linked to the plasticity of a range of biochemical and morphological traits. The fact that there is often a trade-off between temperature-mediated changes in net assimilation rates ({NAR}) and biomass allocation [in particular the specific leaf area ({SLA})] when plants are grown at different temperatures is also highlighted. Also discussed is the role of temperature-mediated changes in photosynthesis and respiration in determining {NAR} values. It is shown that in comparisons that do not take phylogeny into account, fast-growing species exhibit greater temperature-dependent changes in {RGR}, {SLA}, and {NAR} than slow-growing plants. For {RGR} and {NAR}, such trends are maintained within phylogenetically independent contrasts (i.e. species adapted to more-favourable habitats consistently exhibit greater temperature-mediated changes than their congeneric counterparts adapted to less-favourable habitats). By contrast, {SLA} was not consistently more thermally plastic in species from favourable habitats. Interestingly, biomass allocation between leaves and roots was consistently more plastic in slow-growing species within individual phylogenetically independent contrasts, when plants were grown under contrasting temperatures. Finally, how interspecific variations in {NAR} account for an increasing proportion of variability in {RGR} as growth temperatures decrease is highlighted. Conversely, {SLA} played a more dominant role in determining interspecific variability in {RGR} at higher growth temperatures; thus, the importance of {SLA} in determining interspecific variation in {RGR} could potentially increase if annual mean temperatures increase in the future.},

	abstract = {Plant ecologist Anthony David Bradshaw's account of the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity remains central to contemporary research aimed at understanding how organisms persist in heterogeneous environments. Bradshaw suggested that changes in particular traits in response to specific environmental factors could be under direct genetic control, and that natural selection could therefore act directly to shape those responses: plasticity was not “noise” obscuring a genetic signal, but could be specific and refined just as any other adaptive phenotypic trait. In this paper, I document the contexts and development of Bradshaw's investigation of phenotypic plasticity in plants, including a series of unreported experiments in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Contrary to the mythology that later emerged around Bradshaw's ideas, Bradshaw was engaged in a serious and sustained empirical research program concerning plasticity in the 1950s and 1960s that went far beyond a single review paper. Moreover, that work was not isolated, but was surrounded by an already rich theoretical discourse and a substantial body of empirical research concerning the evolution of developmental plasticity and stability. Bradshaw recast the problem of how to understand (and control) plasticity and stability within an epistemic framework focused on genetic differences and natural selection.},

	abstract = {The ability to assimilate C and allocate non-structural carbohydrates ({NSCs}) to the most appropriate organs is crucial to maximize plant ecological or agronomic performance. Such C source and sink activities are differentially affected by environmental constraints. Under drought, plant growth is generally more sink than source limited as organ expansion or appearance rate is earlier and stronger affected than C assimilation. This favors plant survival and recovery but not always agronomic performance as {NSC} are stored rather than used for growth due to a modified metabolism in source and sink leaves. Such interactions between plant C and water balance are complex and plant modeling can help analyzing their impact on plant phenotype. This paper addresses the impact of trade-offs between C sink and source activities and plant production under drought, combining experimental and modeling approaches. Two contrasted monocotyledonous species (rice, oil palm) were studied. Experimentally, the sink limitation of plant growth under moderate drought was confirmed as well as the modifications in {NSC} metabolism in source and sink organs. Under severe stress, when C source became limiting, plant {NSC} concentration decreased. Two plant models dedicated to oil palm and rice morphogenesis were used to perform a sensitivity analysis and further explore how to optimize C sink and source drought sensitivity to maximize plant growth. Modeling results highlighted that optimal drought sensitivity depends both on drought type and species and that modeling is a great opportunity to analyze such complex processes. Further modeling needs and more generally the challenge of using models to support complex trait breeding are discussed.},

	abstract = {Niche differentiation, assumed to be a key mechanism of species coexistence, requires that species differ in their functional traits. So far it remains unclear to which extent trait plasticity leads to niche shifts of species at higher plant diversity, thereby increasing or decreasing niche overlap between species. To analyse this question it is convenient to measure niches indirectly via the variation in resource-uptake traits rather than directly via the resources used. We provisionally call these indirectly measured niches trait-based niches. We studied shoot- and leaf-morphological characteristics in seven legume species in monoculture and multi-species mixture in experimental grassland. Legume species varied in the extent of trait variation in response to plant diversity. Trait plasticity led to significant shifts in species niches in multiple dimensions. Single-species niches in several traits associated with height growth and filling of canopy space were expanded, while other niche dimensions were compressed or did not change with plant diversity. Niche separation among legumes decreased in dimensions related to height growth and space filling, but increased in dimensions related to leaf size and morphology. The total extent of occupied niche space was larger in mixture than in the combined monocultures for dimensions related to leaf morphology and smaller for dimensions related to whole-plant architecture. Taller growth, greater space filling and greater plasticity in shoot height were positively, while larger values and greater plasticity in specific leaf area were negatively related with increased performance of species in mixture. Our study shows that trait variation in response to plant diversity shifts species niches along trait axes. Plastically increased niche differentiation is restricted to niche dimensions that are apparently not related to size-dependent differences between species, but functional equivalence (convergence in height growth) rather than complementarity (divergence in traits associated with light acquisition) explains increased performance of legumes in mixture.},

	abstract = {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

In particular, field studies are lacking that impose artificial selection for a sufficiently long time to elicit changes in phenotypic and genotypic structure of populations. Here, we present findings for an 8-year field experiment with 16 annual plant species that tested potentially adaptive phenotypic responses to precipitation change. In both a Mediterranean and a semi-arid site, annual precipitation was manipulated (±30 \%) and phenotypic response was recorded. We measured flowering time as a key trait related to climatic conditions and biomass and survival as fitness correlates. Differences in traits among treatments were compared to trait shifts between sites, according to space-for-time approaches. In the drier site, phenology was accelerated, but within that site, experimental drought delayed phenology, probably as a plastic response to delayed ontogenetic development. Biomass was smaller in the dry treatments of that site, but it was also reduced in irrigated plots in both sites, indicating more intense competition. The shifts from limitation by drought to limitation by competition corresponded to patterns along the gradient. This also implies a larger negative impact of climate change in the drier site. Our results suggest that experimental selection in the field caused directional responses in most species, but these were not necessarily adaptive. Furthermore, competitive release imposed by climate change may revert direct negative effects of rainfall change in determining plant performance.},

Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental changes, species’ life history characteristics including generation time and breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow. Future studies with standardized methodologies, especially those that use direct approaches assessing responses to climate change over time, and sharing of data through public databases, will facilitate better predictions of the capacity for plant populations to respond to rapid climate change.},

	abstract = {Many studies have recorded phenotypic changes in natural populations and attributed them to climate change. However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing – and exclusion – of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known – and not known – about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed – and these must employ better inferential methods – before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution.},

These approaches can be combined with a number of techniques in genetics and genomics, including association and mapping analyses, genome scans, and transcription profiling. Recent research has revealed a number of candidate genes potentially involved in climate change adaptation and has also illustrated that genetic regulatory networks and epigenetic effects may be particularly relevant for evolution driven by climate change.

	abstract = {Intraspecific adaptation in Abies sachalinensis was examined using models based on long-term monitoring data gathered during a reciprocal transplant experiment with eight seed source populations and six transplantation sites along an altitudinal gradient. The consequence of local adaptation was evaluated by testing the home-site advantage for upslope and downslope transplants at five ages. The populations’ fitness-linked trait was set as their productivity (tree height × survival rate) at each age. The effects of global warming were evaluated on the basis of the 36-year performance of downslope transplants. Evidence was found for adaptive genetic variation affecting both height and survival from an early age. Increasing the distance between seed source and planting site significantly reduced productivity for both upslope and downslope transplantation, demonstrating the existence of a significant home-site advantage. The decrease in productivity was most distinct for upslope transplantations, indicating strong local adaptation to high altitudes. Global warming is predicted to increase the productivity of high-altitude populations. However, owing to their existing local adaptation, all tested populations exhibited lower productivity under warming than demes that were optimal for the new climate. These negative predictions should be considered when planning the management of locally adapted plant species such as A. sachalinensis.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is ubiquitous and generally regarded as a key mechanism for enabling organisms to survive in the face of environmental change. Because no organism is infinitely or ideally plastic, theory suggests that there must be limits (for example, the lack of ability to produce an optimal trait) to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, or that plasticity may have inherent significant costs. Yet numerous experimental studies have not detected widespread costs. Explicitly differentiating plasticity costs from phenotype costs, we re-evaluate fundamental questions of the limits to the evolution of plasticity and of generalists vs specialists. We advocate for the view that relaxed selection and variable selection intensities are likely more important constraints to the evolution of plasticity than the costs of plasticity. Some forms of plasticity, such as learning, may be inherently costly. In addition, we examine opportunities to offset costs of phenotypes through ontogeny, amelioration of phenotypic costs across environments, and the condition-dependent hypothesis. We propose avenues of further inquiry in the limits of plasticity using new and classic methods of ecological parameterization, phylogenetics and omics in the context of answering questions on the constraints of plasticity. Given plasticity’s key role in coping with environmental change, approaches spanning the spectrum from applied to basic will greatly enrich our understanding of the evolution of plasticity and resolve our understanding of limits.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants. The expression of an individual genotype is modified by its environment. The amount by which it can be modified is termed its plasticity. This plasticity can be either morphological or physiological; these are interrelated. The plasticity of a character is related to the general pattern of its development, and apart from this, that plasticity is a general property of the whole genotype. Plasticity of a character appears to be specific for that character, specific in relation to particular environmental influences, specific in direction, under genetic control not necessarily related to heterozygosity, and able to be radically altered by selection. Because plants are static organisms, plasticity is of marked adaptive value in a great number of situations. Examples of all these situations in plant species are discussed. They indicate that adaptation by plasticity is a widespread and important phenomenon in plants and has evolved differently in different species. The mechanisms involved in plasticity are varied. At one extreme, the character shows a continuous range of modification dependent on the intensity of the environmental stimulus. At the other, the character shows only two discrete modifications. The stimulus causing these modifications may be direct or indirect. The mechanisms found can be related to the particular environmental situation involved.},

	abstract = {The ability of a genotype to change its phenotype was once considered rather a nuisance – making it difficult to define a genotype. This led to the idea that there was a problem called ‘instability’. But quite early it was recognized that stability was under genetic control, and was a character like other attributes of an individual. From this realization came the idea that there were two sides to the character of ‘instability’, and that the ability to change could be important. This ability was thus given the title of ‘plasticity’. Once recognized, it became clear from surveys of different species and populations that plasticity can (i) be a complex character, and (ii) be selected to fit species to the particular demands of different environments. For plants, which cannot meet variations in environment like animals by behavioural responses, phenotypic plasticity can be very important. Plants should therefore be valuable tools for unravelling the mechanisms of plasticity whilst also demonstrating its contribution to fitness experimentally. We ought also to be able to demonstrate that appropriate genetic variability is available through which complex responses can be built up by selection. Genes must exist not only to determine character means, but also to determine character response, which adds interesting complexity to our ideas about evolution.},

The consequences of developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility for the performance and ecological success of populations and species have attracted a comparatively limited but currently growing interest. Here, I re-emphasize that an increased understanding of the roles of plasticity in these contexts requires a ‘whole organism’ (rather than ‘single trait’) approach, taking into consideration that organisms are integrated complex phenotypes. I further argue that plasticity and genetic polymorphism should be analysed and discussed within a common framework. I summarize predictions from theory on how phenotypic variation stemming from developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility may affect different aspects of population-level performance. I argue that it is important to distinguish between effects associated with greater interindividual phenotypic variation resulting from plasticity, and effects mediated by variation among individuals in the capacity to express plasticity and flexibility as such. Finally, I claim that rigorous testing of predictions requires methods that allow for quantifying and comparing whole organism plasticity, as well as the ability to experimentally manipulate the level of and capacity for developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility independent of genetic variation.},

Consequently, the contribution to the functioning of ecosystems of variation among individuals should be accounted for. However, very little is known about patterns of diversity below the species level, and less still about the patterns of individual diversity and their relation to ecosystem context and community function. We present a model for the dynamics of individuals that is physiologically based and spatially explicit. Individuals are defined in terms of measurable parameters that relate environmental context to phenotype and in this sense define the genotype. Estimates for the variation in the parameter values are obtained from experiments conducted on the species Rumex acetosa. Simulations are performed to predict the form of the relative abundance distribution, and the dependence of the predicted number of coexisting genotypes on patch area (the genotype–area curve). We find that the predicted forms of the abundance distribution and genotype–area curve are indistinguishable from those measured at the species level. Furthermore, we identify the importance of physiological trade-offs at the individual level in promoting diversity and the sensitivity of genotype richness to the degree of similarity of individuals in the community. The extension of the model to include inter-species variation is discussed.},

We investigate this relation using a generic individual-based modelling framework described in part 1, in which individuals within a community are characterised by physiological traits and interact within a spatially structured environment. We explore the effect of intraspecific variation among individuals on community-scale productivity in a range of homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We show that diversity among individuals has a significant, and in most but not all cases positive, impact on community productivity. At low levels of resource the persisting plants giving highest productivity have slowest uptake rates and longest times to reproduction. In contrast, at high levels of resource the persisting plants giving highest productivity have highest uptake levels and shortest time to reproduction. Thus, the individuals’ trait distributions defining community functioning emerge, after many iterations of the model, from the surviving individuals. We, therefore, show that different mechanisms, as evidenced in the surviving individuals’ traits, increase community productivity in different environmental contexts, and so demonstrate the importance of accounting for diversity at the scale of the individual. Consequently, progress may be made in linking diversity and function by considering small, manageable systems and making physiological measurements on individuals.},

However, dynamic global vegetation models ({DGVMs}) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types ({PFTs}) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the {DGVM} {LPJmL} (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called {LPJmL}- flexible individual traits ({LPJmL}-{FIT}) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. {LPJmL}-{FIT} incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the {TRY} global plant trait database, namely specific leaf area ({SLA}), leaf longevity ({LL}), leaf nitrogen content (Narea), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea), and wood density ({WD}). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. {LPJmL}-{FIT} enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the {DGVM} to current challenges in ecosystem management from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.},

We investigated (1) how the joint genetic architecture of {WUE}, reproductive characters, and vegetative traits changed across drought and well-watered conditions, (2) whether traits with distinct developmental bases (e.g. leaf gas exchange versus reproduction) differed in the environmental sensitivity of their genetic architecture, and (3) whether quantitative variation in circadian period was related to drought response in Brassica rapa. Overall, {WUE} increased in drought, primarily because stomatal conductance, and thus water loss, declined more than carbon fixation. Genotypes with the highest {WUE} in drought expressed the lowest {WUE} in well-watered conditions, and had the largest vegetative and floral organs in both treatments. Thus, large changes in {WUE} enabled some genotypes to approach vegetative and reproductive trait optima across environments. The genetic architecture differed for gas-exchange and vegetative traits across drought and well-watered conditions, but not for floral traits. Correlations between circadian and leaf gas-exchange traits were significant but did not vary across treatments, indicating that circadian period affects physiological function regardless of water availability. These results suggest that {WUE} is important for drought tolerance in Brassica rapa and that artificial selection for increased {WUE} in drought will not result in maladaptive expression of other traits that are correlated with {WUE}.},

Greenhouse screening of 39 genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana native to habitats spanning a wide range of climatic conditions, revealed a highly significant positive genetic correlation between δ13C and flowering time. Studies in a range of C3 annuals have also reported large positive correlations, suggesting the presence of a genetically based trade-off between mechanisms of dehydration avoidance (δ13C) and drought escape (early flowering). We examined the contribution of pleiotropy by using a combination of mutant and near-isogenic lines to test for positive mutational covariance between δ13C and flowering time. Ecophysiological mutants generally showed variation in δ13C but not flowering time. However, flowering time mutants generally demonstrated pleiotropic effects consistent with natural variation. Mutations that caused later flowering also typically resulted in less negative δ13C and thus probably higher water use efficiency. We found strong evidence for pleiotropy using near-isogenic lines of {FRIGIDA} and {FLOWERING} {LOCUS} C, cloned loci known to be responsible for natural variation in flowering time. These data suggest the correlated evolution of δ13C and flowering time is explained in part by the fixation of pleiotropic alleles that alter both δ13C and time to flowering.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims
Trade-offs are fundamental to life-history theory, and the leaf size vs. number trade-off has recently been suggested to be of importance to our understanding leaf size evolution. The purpose of the present study was to test whether the isometric, negative relationship between leaf size and number found by Kleiman and Aarssen is conserved between plant functional types and between habitats.

Methods
Leaf mass, area and number, and stem mass and volume of current-year shoots were measured for 107 temperate broadleaved woody species at two altitudes on Gongga Mountain, south-west China. The scaling relationships of leaf size (leaf area and mass) vs. (mass- and volume-based) leafing intensity were analysed in relation to leaf habit, leaf form and habitat type. Trait relationships were determined with both a standardized major axis method and a phylogenetically independent comparative method.

Key Results
Significant negative, isometric scaling relationships between leaf size and leafing intensity were found to be consistently conserved across species independent of leaf habit, leaf form and habitat type. In particular, about 99 \% of the variation in leaf mass across species could be accounted for by proportional variation in mass-based leafing intensity. The negative correlations between leaf size and leafing intensity were also observed across correlated evolutionary divergences. However, evergreen species had a lower y-intercept in the scaling relationships of leaf area vs. leafing intensity than deciduous species. This indicated that leaf area was smaller in the evergreen species at a given leafing intensity than in the deciduous species. The compound-leaved deciduous species were observed usually to have significant upper shifts along the common slopes relative to the simple-leaved species, which suggested that the compound-leaved species were larger in leaf size but smaller in leafing intensity than their simple counterparts. No significant difference was found in the scaling relationships between altitudes.

Conclusions
The negative, isometric scaling relationship between leaf size and number is largely conserved in plants, while the leaf size vs. number trade-off can be mediated by leaf properties. The isometry of the leaf size vs. number relationship may simply result from a biomass allocation trade-off, although a twig size constraint may provide an alternative mechanism.},

	abstract = {* 1Using a sample of 24 common deciduous angiosperm trees of the Eastern Deciduous Forest region of North America, we tested the hypothesis that leaf size variation across species can be interpreted in terms of a trade-off between individual leaf mass and the number of leaves produced.
* 2The true nature of a resource allocation trade-off is detectable only if variation in the total amount of growth is accounted for. We controlled for this effect by measuring all of the components of annual growth associated with leaf production at the individual terminal shoot level. Hence, number of leaves produced was expressed as ‘leafing intensity’, i.e. the number of leaves produced by newly emerged (current year's) shoots, divided by the total volume of these shoots.
* 3Ninety per cent (r2 = 0.90) of the variation in mean individual leaf mass across species, spanning two orders of magnitude, could be accounted for by proportional variation in mean leafing intensity, i.e. representing an isometric trade-off, with a slope for log-transformed data that did not deviate significantly from −1.0.
* 4We suggest that this isometric relationship may represent a generalized trade-off strategy for leaf deployment at the shoot level within temperate deciduous woody species. Following traditional interpretations, adaptation here may involve a fitness benefit associated with a particular leaf size. The present results also suggest an alternative, i.e. selection may instead favour high leafing intensity, with small leaf mass resulting not as a direct adaptation, but simply as a trade-off.
* 5According to this ‘leafing intensity premium’ hypothesis, the fitness benefits of higher leafing intensity are associated primarily with the fitness benefits of a larger pool of lateral meristems, because each leaf is usually associated with an axillary bud. This may in turn provide greater facility for wide phenotypic plasticity in the allocation of these meristems to vegetative vs. reproductive functions. This represents a plausible hypothesis, we suggest, in accounting for why most woody deciduous angiosperms, even some of the largest/tallest ones, have relatively small leaves.},

Recent comparative data make it possible to quantify the cross‐species trade‐off between the first variable and the second variable. Here we develop an approach through which the consequences of the third variable, the time‐discount rate, can be related to the trade‐off between the first variable and the second variable. The approach involves an equal‐benefit set, the cross‐species equivalent of a fitness set. A wide spread of strategies is actually observed to coexist in vegetation, from low to high light capture area per gram and, correspondingly, from high to low leaf longevity. The coexistence suggests that the different observed strategies do not have a clear‐cut advantage over the other. The equal‐benefit set can be used to investigate what levels of time discount would make it the case that neither the highest‐longevity nor the highest light‐capture area per milligram strategies would have a clear advantage over the other, with regard to the time‐discounted value of the revenue stream generated per milligram invested in leaf.},

Drought resistance adaptations in nature reflect natural rather than human-mediated selection and may identify novel mechanisms for stress tolerance. Adaptations conferring drought resistance have historically been divided into alternative strategies including drought escape (rapid development to complete a life cycle before drought) and drought avoidance (reducing water loss to prevent dehydration). Recent studies in genetic model systems such as Arabidopsis, Mimulus, and Panicum have begun to elucidate the genes, expression profiles, and physiological changes responsible for ecologically important variation in drought resistance. Similar to most crop plants, variation in drought escape and avoidance is complex, underlain by many {QTL} of small effect, and pervasive gene by environment interactions. Recently identified major-effect alleles point to a significant role for genetic constraints in limiting the concurrent evolution of both drought escape and avoidance strategies, although these constraints are not universally found. This progress suggests that understanding the mechanistic basic and fitness consequences of gene by environment interactions will be critical for crop improvement and forecasting population persistence in unpredictable environments.},

	abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a deciduous perennial plant is studied theoretically. We make three basic assumptions. First, the daily net photosynthetic rate of a plant increases but saturates with the size of the production part (vegetative organs working for photosynthesis). Second, the production part is discarded at the end of a growing season, but it may be rebuilt at the beginning of the next season using stored material. And finally, the plant maximizes the lifetime reproductive investment by choosing both the growth schedule within each season and the resource allocation between reproduction for the year and storage for the next season. The model is analyzed by the combination of maximum principle and dynamic programming. Our analysis showed three basic results. First, the annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. Second, under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value S*, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger than S*, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). Finally, reproductive effort (the ratio of reproductive investment to total annual production) of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season, which quantitatively fits the available data. In light of the model, reported growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by two quantities: productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). The timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant, in contrast, is controlled mainly by stability (it ceases earlier at a more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity.},

These factors, which are not included in most standard competition models, allow stable coexistence of trophically equivalent species due to: Differences in life-history ‘strategy’.

The model is similar to that proposed by Moran (1992) but extends her work to two sites. We show that with migration between sites the plastic type is favored over local specialists across a broad range of parameter space. The plastic type may dominate or be fixed even in an environmentally uniform site, and even if the plasticity has imperfect accuracy or bears some cost such that a local specialist has higher fitness in that site, as long as there is some migration between sites with different distributions of environmental states. These results suggest that differences among taxa in dispersal and hence realized migration rates may play a heretofore unrecognized role in their patterns of adaptive population differentiation. Migration relaxes the thresholds for both environmental heterogeneity and accuracy of plastic response above which plasticity is favored. Furthermore, small changes in response accuracy can dramatically and abruptly alter the evolutionary outcome in the metapopulation. A fitness cost to plasticity will substantially reduce the range of conditions in which the plastic type will prevail only if the cost is both large and global rather than environment specific.},

	abstract = {Questions

It remains unresolved why, despite the obvious functional importance of leaves and roots, co-existing plant species can display highly contrasting biomass distributions of these organs. Building on the ‘functional equilibrium’ hypothesis, we hypothesize that co-existing species can each achieve balanced resource acquisition above vs below ground by trading off the biomass vs morphology of structures responsible for resource acquisition, i.e. leaves and fine roots.


Methods

We tested this hypothesis in a natural field setting by measuring plant above- and below-ground biomass and morphological traits associated with resource uptake – specific leaf area ({SLA}) and specific root length ({SRL}) – of 18 dominant angiosperm species from a sub-alpine plant community.


Location

New Zealand South Island.


Results

We found a significant negative relationship between the species leaf mass to fine root mass ratio and the {SLA} to {SRL} ratio when we considered eudicot species only. The {SLA} to {SRL} ratio and plant size explained 31\% and 34\% of the total variation in the species leaf to fine root mass ratio respectively, and 45\% when used in combination (P {\textless} 0.05 in all cases). Within a given plant size, 90\% of the variation among species in total leaf area was due to differences in {SLA}, whereas variation in the fine root mass fraction was responsible for 71\% of the variation among species in fine root length.


Conclusions

In support of our hypothesis, part of the difference between co-occurring species in leaf and fine root biomass distribution could be explained by the variable morphologies of these organs as well as variation in plant size, independent of the plant economic strategy. We expect that this outcome may result from environmental and evolutionary constraints on plant species-average traits, as well as plastic responses to local environmental conditions. These findings help explain why a diversity of strategies for achieving balanced resource acquisition can co-exist within a single plant community.},

The seasonal timing, or phenology, of life-stage transitions determines the environmental conditions to which each life stage is exposed and the length of time required to complete a generation. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to phenological variation, yet predicting their combined effect on life cycles across a geographic range remains a challenge. We linked submodels of the plasticity of individual life stages to create an integrated model that predicts life-cycle phenology in complex environments. We parameterized the model for Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated life cycles in four locations. We compared multiple “genotypes” by varying two parameters associated with natural genetic variation in phenology: seed dormancy and floral repression. The model predicted variation in life cycles across locations that qualitatively matches observed natural phenology. Seed dormancy had larger effects on life-cycle length than floral repression, and results suggest that a genetic cline in dormancy maintains a life-cycle length of 1 year across the geographic range of this species. By integrating across life stages, this approach demonstrates how genetic variation in one transition can influence subsequent transitions and the geographic distribution of life cycles more generally.},

	abstract = {• Background and Aims In a leaf canopy, there is a turnover of leaves; i.e. they are produced, senesce and fall. These processes determine the amount of leaf area in the canopy, which in turn determines canopy photosynthesis. The turnover rate of leaves is affected by environmental factors and is different among species. This mini-review discusses factors responsible for leaf dynamics in plant canopies, focusing on the role of nitrogen.
• Scope Leaf production is supported by canopy photosynthesis that is determined by distribution of light and leaf nitrogen. Leaf nitrogen determines photosynthetic capacity. Nitrogen taken up from roots is allocated to new leaves. When leaves age or their light availability is lowered, part of the leaf nitrogen is resorbed. Resorbed nitrogen is re-utilized in new organs and the rest is lost with dead leaves. The sink–source balance is important in the regulation of leaf senescence. Several models have been proposed to predict response to environmental changes. A mathematical model that incorporated nitrogen use for photosynthesis explained well the variations in leaf lifespan within and between species.
• Conclusion When leaf turnover is at a steady state, the ratio of biomass production to nitrogen uptake is equal to the ratio of litter fall to nitrogen loss, which is an inverse of the nitrogen concentration in dead leaves. Thus nitrogen concentration in dead leaves (nitrogen resorption proficiency) and nitrogen availability in the soil determine the rate of photosynthesis in the canopy. Dynamics of leaves are regulated so as to maximize carbon gain and resource-use efficiency of the plant.},

Mimicry refers to adaptive similarity between a mimic organism and a model. Mimicry in animals is rather common, whereas documented cases in plants are rare, and the associated benefits are seldom elucidated [1, 2]. We show the occurrence of leaf mimicry in a climbing plant endemic to a temperate rainforest. The woody vine Boquila trifoliolata mimics the leaves of its supporting trees in terms of size, shape, color, orientation, petiole length, and/or tip spininess. Moreover, sequential leaf mimicry occurs when a single individual vine is associated with different tree species. Leaves of unsupported vines differed from leaves of climbing plants closely associated with tree foliage but did not differ from those of vines climbing onto leafless trunks. Consistent with an herbivory-avoidance hypothesis, leaf herbivory on unsupported vines was greater than that on vines climbing on trees but was greatest on vines climbing onto leafless trunks. Thus, B. trifoliolata gains protection against herbivory not merely by climbing and thus avoiding ground herbivores [3] but also by climbing onto trees whose leaves are mimicked. Unlike earlier cases of plant mimicry or crypsis, in which the plant roughly resembles a background or color pattern [4–7] or mimics a single host [8, 9], B. trifoliolata is able to mimic several hosts.},

We sampled three populations of Hypochaeris radicata that differed significantly in rosette diameter and specific leaf area ({SLA}). We grew nine maternal lines from each population (27 lines total) under three greenhouse conditions: ambient conditions (control), 50\% drought, or 80\% shade. Plant diameter and relative chlorophyll content were measured throughout the experiment, and leaf shape, root∶shoot ratio, and {SLA} were measured after five weeks. We used hierarchical mixed-models and variance component analysis to quantify differences in treatment effects and the contributions of population of origin and maternal line to observed variation. Observed variation in plant traits was driven primarily by plasticity. Shade significantly influenced all measured traits. Plant diameter was the only trait that had a sizable proportion of trait variation (30\%) explained by population of origin. There were significant ontogenetic differences for both plant diameter and relative chlorophyll content. When subjected to abiotic stress in the form of light or water limitation, Hypochaeris radicata exhibited significant trait variability. This variation was due primarily to trait plasticity, rather than to adaptation to local conditions, and also differed with ontogeny.},

Characterizing intraspecific variation of alpine plants along elevational gradients is crucial for estimating their vulnerability to predicted changes. Environmental conditions vary with elevation, which might influence plastic responses and affect selection pressures that lead to local adaptation. Thus, local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity among low and high elevation plant populations in response to climate, soil and other factors associated with elevational gradients might underlie different responses of these populations to climate warming. Using a transplant experiment along an elevational gradient, we investigated reproductive phenology, growth and reproduction of the nutrient-poor grassland species Ranunculus bulbosus, Trifolium montanum and Briza media. Seeds were collected from low and high elevation source populations across the Swiss Alps and grown in nine common gardens at three different elevations with two different soil depths. Despite genetic differentiation in some traits, the results revealed no indication of local adaptation to the elevation of population origin. Reproductive phenology was advanced at lower elevation in low and high elevation populations of all three species. Growth and reproduction of T. montanum and B. media were hardly affected by garden elevation and soil depth. In R. bulbosus, however, growth decreased and reproductive investment increased at higher elevation. Furthermore, soil depth influenced growth and reproduction of low elevation R. bulbosus populations. We found no evidence for local adaptation to elevation of origin and hardly any differences in the responses of low and high elevation populations. However, the consistent advanced reproductive phenology observed in all three species shows that they have the potential to plastically respond to environmental variation. We conclude that populations might not be forced to migrate to higher elevations as a consequence of climate warming, as plasticity will buffer the detrimental effects of climate change in the three investigated nutrient-poor grassland species.},

However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing – and exclusion – of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known – and not known – about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed – and these must employ better inferential methods – before general conclusions can be drawn.

Abstract
Do invasive plant species have greater phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species? And, if so, how does this affect their fitness relative to native, non-invasive species? What role might this play in plant invasions? To answer these long-standing questions, we conducted a meta-analysis using data from 75 invasive/non-invasive species pairs. Our analysis shows that invasive species demonstrate significantly higher phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species. To examine the adaptive benefit of this plasticity, we plotted fitness proxies against measures of plasticity in several growth, morphological and physiological traits to test whether greater plasticity is associated with an improvement in estimated fitness. Invasive species were nearly always more plastic in their response to greater resource availability than non-invasives but this plasticity was only sometimes associated with a fitness benefit. Intriguingly, non-invasive species maintained greater fitness homoeostasis when comparing growth between low and average resource availability. Our finding that invasive species are more plastic in a variety of traits but that non-invasive species respond just as well, if not better, when resources are limiting, has interesting implications for predicting responses to global change.},

However, the potential scope of such phenotypic effects and their evolutionary significance are largely unexplored.


* Here, we conducted a glasshouse experiment in which we tested the response of a large number of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines ({epiRILs}) of Arabidopsis thaliana – lines that are nearly isogenic but highly variable at the level of {DNA} methylation – to drought and increased nutrient conditions.


* We found significant heritable variation among {epiRILs} both in the means of several ecologically important plant traits and in their plasticities to drought and nutrients. Significant selection gradients, that is, fitness correlations, of several mean traits and plasticities suggest that selection could act on this epigenetically based phenotypic variation.


* Our study provides evidence that variation in {DNA} methylation can cause substantial heritable variation of ecologically important plant traits, including root allocation, drought tolerance and nutrient plasticity, and that rapid evolution based on epigenetic variation alone should thus be possible.},

	abstract = {Adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolves when cues reliably predict fitness consequences of life-history decisions, whereas bet hedging evolves when environments are unpredictable. These modes of response should be jointly expressed, because environmental variance is composed of both predictable and unpredictable components. However, little attention has been paid to the joint expression of plasticity and bet hedging. Here, I examine the simultaneous expression of plasticity in germination rate and two potential bet-hedging traits – germination fraction and within-season diversification in timing of germination – in seeds from multiple seed families of five geographically distant populations of Lobelia inflata (L.) subjected to a thermal gradient. Populations differ in germination plasticity to temperature, in total germination fraction and in the expression of potential diversification in the timing of germination. The observation of a negative partial correlation between the expression of plasticity and germination variance (potential diversification), and a positive correlation between plasticity and germination fraction is suggestive of a trade-off between modes of response to environmental variance. If the observed correlations are indicative of those between adaptive plasticity and bet hedging, we expect an optimal balance to exist and differ among populations. I discuss the challenges involved in testing whether the balance between plasticity and bet hedging depends on the relative predictability of environmental variance.},

This decreased availability of water is quantified as a decrease in water potential. Plants resist low water potential and related stresses by modifying water uptake and loss to avoid low water potential, accumulating solutes and modifying the properties of cell walls to avoid the dehydration induced by low water potential and using protective proteins and mechanisms to tolerate reduced water content by preventing or repairing cell damage. Salt stress also alters plant ion homeostasis, and under many conditions this may be the predominant factor affecting plant performance. Our emphasis is on experiments that quantify resistance to realistic and reproducible low water potential (drought), salt and freezing stresses while being suitable for genetic studies where a large number of lines must be analyzed. Detailed protocols for the use of polyethylene glycol-infused agar plates to impose low water potential stress, assay of salt tolerance based on root elongation, quantification of freezing tolerance and the use of electrolyte leakage experiments to quantify cellular damage induced by freezing and low water potential are also presented.},

Here, we explore how multiple local environmental gradients in resources required by plants (light, water, and nutrients) and soil disturbance together influence the direction and amplitude of intraspecific changes in leaf and fine root traits that facilitate capture of these resources. We measured population-level analogous above- and belowground traits related to resource acquisition, i.e. “specific leaf area”–“specific root length” ({SLA}–{SRL}), and leaf and root N, P, and dry matter content ({DMC}), on three dominant understory tree species with contrasting carbon and nutrient economics across 15 plots in a temperate forest influenced by burrowing seabirds. We observed similar responses of the three species to the same single environmental influences, but partially species-specific responses to combinations of influences. The strength of intraspecific above- and belowground trait responses appeared unrelated to species resource acquisition strategy. Finally, most analogous leaf and root traits ({SLA} vs. {SRL}, and leaf versus root P and {DMC}) were controlled by contrasting environmental influences. The decoupled responses of above- and belowground traits to these multiple environmental factors together with partially species-specific adjustments suggest complex responses of plant communities to environmental changes, and potentially contrasting feedbacks of plant traits with ecosystem properties. We demonstrate that despite the growing evidence for broadly consistent resource-acquisition strategies at the whole plant level among species, plants also show partially decoupled, finely tuned strategies between above- and belowground parts at the intraspecific level in response to their environment. This decoupling within species suggests a need for many species-centred ecological theories on how plants respond to their environments (e.g. competitive/stress-tolerant/ruderal and response-effect trait frameworks) to be adapted to account for distinct plant-environment interactions among distinct individuals of the same species and parts of the same individual.},

The phenotypic plasticity of a given genotype, or the range of phenotypes, that can be expressed dependent upon environment becomes something we can feasibly assess. Of particular importance is phenotypic variation that increases fitness or survival – adaptive phenotypic plasticity.

Examples of proven adaptive plasticity in plants, however, are scarce and most plastic responses actually may be ‘passive’ rather than adaptive. This suggests that frequently requirements for the evolution of adaptive plasticity are not met or that such evolution is impeded by constraints. Here we outline requirements and potential constraints for the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, identify open questions, and propose new research approaches. Important open questions concern the genetic background of plasticity, genetic variation in plasticity, selection for plasticity in natural habitats, and the nature and occurrence of costs and limits of plasticity. Especially promising tools to address these questions are selection gradient analysis, meta-analysis of studies on genotype-by-environment interactions, {QTL} analysis, {cDNA}-microarray scanning and quantitative {PCR} to quantify gene expression, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to quantify protein expression. Studying plasticity along the pathway from gene expression to the phenotype and its relationship with fitness will help us to better understand why adaptive plasticity is not more universal, and to more realistically predict the evolution of plastic responses to environmental change.},

Furthermore, plasticity was more often adaptive for plants of low-elevation origin and maladaptive for plants of high elevation. With methylation sensitive-{AFLP} ({MS}-{AFLP}), we revealed an increase in epigenetic variation in response to temperature in low-elevation seedlings.

Despite this abundant variation, we still know little about the complex genetic architecture of drought tolerance or its role in constraining evolution. Unfortunately, few natural allelic variants have been cloned for drought related traits — progress cloning {QTL}, the use of {RNA}-sequencing methods for evaluating gene expression responses to soil drying, and improved methodology for exploring complex multivariate data all hold promise for moving the field forward.

No existing theory satisfactorily explains all of these trends.

We review the evidence for bet-hedging in a range of simple plant systems that have proved particularly tractable for studying bet-hedging under natural conditions. We begin by outlining the essential theory, reiterating the important distinction between conservative and diversified bet-hedging strategies. We then examine the theory and empirical evidence for the canonical example of bet-hedging: diversification via dormant seeds in annual plants. We discuss the complications that arise when moving beyond this simple case to consider more complex life-history traits, such as flowering size in semelparous perennial plants. Finally, we outline a framework for accommodating these complications, emphasizing the central role that model-based approaches can play.},

	abstract = {abstract: Disturbance regimes are ecologically important, but many of their evolutionary consequences are poorly understood. A model is developed here that combines the within‐ and among‐season dynamics of disturbances with evolutionary life‐history theory. “Disturbance regime” is defined in terms of disturbance timing, frequency, predictability, and severity. The model predicts the optimal body size and time at which organisms should abandon a disturbance‐prone growth habitat by maturing and moving to a disturbance‐free, nongrowth habitat. The effects of both coarse‐grained (those affecting the entire population synchronously) and fine‐grained disturbances (those occurring in a patch dynamics setting) are explored. Several predictions are congruent with previous theory. Infrequent or temporally unpredictable disturbances should have little effect on the evolution of life‐history strategies, even though they may cause high mortality. Similar to seasonal time constraints on reproduction, disturbance regimes can synchronize metamorphosis within a population, resulting in a seasonal decline in body size at maturity. Other model predictions are novel. When disturbances cause high mortality, coarse‐grained disturbances have a much stronger effect on life‐history strategies than fine‐grained disturbances, suggesting that population structure (relative to the scale of disturbance) plays a critical evolutionary role when disturbances are severe. When within‐population variance in juvenile body size is high, two consecutive seasonal declines in body size at maturity can occur, the first associated with disturbance regime and the second associated with seasonal time constraints.},

We found that small-seeded species were more abundant in the seed rain than large-seeded species. However, this numerical advantage was lost by seedling emergence. The disadvantage of small-seeded species probably results from size-selective post-dispersal seed predation, or the longer time small-seeded species spend in the soil before germination. Seedlings from large-seeded species have higher survival through a given amount of time as seedlings. However, this advantage seems to be countered by the greater time taken for large-seeded species to reach reproductive maturity: our data suggested no relationship, or perhaps a weak negative relationship, between seed size and survival from seedling emergence through to adulthood. A previous compilation showed that the inverse relationship between seed mass and the number of seeds produced per unit canopy area per year is countered by positive relationships between seed mass, plant size and plant longevity. Taken together, these data show that our old understanding of a species’ seed mass as the result of a trade–off between producing a few large offspring, each with high survival probability, versus producing many small offspring each with a lower chance of successfully establishing was incomplete. It seems more likely that seed size evolves as part of a spectrum of life history traits, including plant size, plant longevity, juvenile survival rate and time to reproduction.},

	abstract = {Trade-offs and constraints are key ideas in plant defense theory. Here I argue that trade-offs, such as those between defense and growth, may be better understood by incorporating insights from life-history studies. Specifically, I set out criteria for characterizing resource based trade-offs, because these lie at the heart of current defense theory. I show that defense theory is often supported by inappropriate evidence from negative trait associations seen in the field, or from genetic studies. Such evidence is inappropriate because trade-offs grounded in genetic constraints can differ fundamentally from those conceived in terms of limiting resources. In work on resource based trade-offs there is often a failure to consider the critical issues of whether the resources involved are limiting, and whether this limitation is imposed by the assimilatory capacity of the organism or by a shortage in its environment. Another important consideration is whether a trade-off is between two traits that jointly consume all resources. Where this is not the case, unforeseen trade-offs with "third party traits" may confound analyses. I discuss the practical issues of resolving these problems with plants, and present a program for future research on resource based trade-offs involving plant defense.},

	abstract = {We present a novel optimal allocation model for perennial plants, in which assimilates are not allocated directly to vegetative or reproductive parts but instead go first to a storage compartment from where they are then optimally redistributed. We do not restrict considerations purely to periods favourable for photosynthesis, as it was done in published models of perennial species, but analyse the whole life period of a perennial plant. As a result, we obtain the general scheme of perennial plant development, for which annual and monocarpic strategies are special cases.

We not only re-derive predictions from several previous optimal allocation models, but also obtain more information about plants׳ strategies during transitions between favourable and unfavourable seasons. One of the model׳s predictions is that a plant can begin to re-establish vegetative tissues from storage some time before the beginning of favourable conditions, which in turn allows for better production potential when conditions become better. By means of numerical examples we show that annual plants with single or multiple reproduction periods, monocarps, evergreen perennials and polycarpic perennials can be studied successfully with the help of our unified model.

Finally, we build a bridge between optimal allocation models and models describing trade-offs between size and the number of seeds: a modelled plant can control the distribution of not only allocated carbohydrates but also seed size. We provide sufficient conditions for the optimality of producing the smallest and largest seeds possible.},

	abstract = {In this study we analyse relationships between seed number, seed size, seedling size and recruitment success in grassland plants. The often hypothesised trade-off between seed size and seed number was supported by a cross-species analysis and by an analysis of 35 phylogenetically independent contrasts, derived from a data-set of 72 species. Apart from among-species relatedness, we also controlled for possible confounding effect of plant size that may influence both seed size and seed number. A sowing experiment with 50 species was performed in the field. The seeds were sown in a grassland and subjected to two treatments, disturbance and undisturbed sward. Evidence for seed-limited recruitment was obtained for 45 of the species. Disturbance had a significant, or nearly significant, positive effect on recruitment for 16 of the 45 species. The relative recruitment in undisturbed sward increased with increased seed size, and both recruitment success and seedling size were positively related to seed size. We suggest that a trade-off between competitive ability and number of recruitment opportunities follows from the trade-off between seed size and seed number, through a causal chain from seed size via seedling size to recruitment success. The relationships between seed size, seed number and recruitment may be an important underlying mechanism for abundance and dynamics of plant species in grassland vegetation. This is an example of a direct link between evolutionary life-history theory, and theory of plant community structure.},

	abstract = {Physiological and ecological constraints play key roles in the evolution of plant growth patterns, especially in relation to defenses against herbivores. Phenotypic and life history theories are unified within the growth-differentiation balance ({GDB}) framework, forming an integrated system of theories explaining and predicting patterns of plant defense and competitive interactions in ecological and evolutionary time. Plant activity at the cellular level can be classified as growth (cell division and enlargement) of differentiation (chemical and morphological changes leading to cell maturation and specialization). The {GDB} hypothesis of plant defense is premised upon a physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes. The trade-off between growth and defense exists because secondary metabolism and structural reinforcement are physiologically constrained in dividing and enlarging cells, and because they divert resources from the production of new leaf area. Hence the dilemma of plants: They must grow fast enough to complete, yet maintain the defenses necessary to survive in the presence of pathogens and hervivores. The physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes interacts with herbivory and plant-plant competition to manifest itself as a genetic trade-off between growth and defense in the evolution of plant life history strategies. Evolutionary theories of plant defense are reviewed. We also extend a standard growth rate model by separating its ecological and evolutionary components,and formalizing the role of competition in the evolution of plant defense. We conclude with a conceptual model of the evolution of plant defense in which plant physioligical trade-offs interact with the abiotic environment, competition and herbivory.},

	abstract = {This study examines whether post-dispersal seed predators could be an important selective force in determining the seed bank strategies of grassland plants. It tests the hypothesis that species with persistent seed banks should sustain proportionally less predation of buried seeds than species which have transient seed banks and that this should be true irrespective of seed size. Results are drawn from a field experiment examining the relative susceptibility of surface versus buried seeds for 19 herbaceous taxa exhibiting different degrees of seed bank persistence. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that seed predators (rodents) influence the seed bank characteristics of seeds. Rodents removed proportionally more large seeds than small seeds and removed a smaller proportion of seeds with persistent rather than transient seed banks, independently of seed size. On average, burial reduced seed removal by almost 50\%. The decrease in rates of seed removal following burial was marked for seeds with persistent seed banks but negligible for seeds with transient seed banks. Herbaceous plants with relatively large seeds (seed mass {\textgreater} 1 mg) that form persistent seed banks were either completely avoided or only consumed in small quantities by rodents. In contrast, large-seeded species with transient seed banks suffer high rates of seed predation. Models of life-history evolution predict trade-offs between seed dormancy and seed mass since dormancy and seed size are correlated traits that both reduce risk in variable environments and thus will show patterns of negative covariation. This paper presents an alternative explanation for this trade-off based on experimental evidence of a negative relationship between seed bank persistence and predation risk.},

Examples are drawn from recent studies showing adaptive response by genotypes to physical aspects of the environment, as well as to biotic factors such as neighbour density and the presence of bacterial symbionts. Alterations of offspring traits by parental plants of Polygonum persicaria are discussed as a cross-generational aspect of plastic response to environment. Finally, individual plasticity and local ecotypes are examined as alternative bases of species ecological breadth, and methodological problems in distinguishing these alternatives are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims A standardized methodology to assess the impacts of land-use changes on vegetation and ecosystem functioning is presented. It assumes that species traits are central to these impacts, and is designed to be applicable in different historical, climatic contexts and local settings. Preliminary results are presented to show its applicability.
Methods Eleven sites, representative of various types of land-use changes occurring in marginal agro-ecosystems across Europe and Israel, were selected. Climatic data were obtained at the site level; soil data, disturbance and nutrition indices were described at the plot level within sites. Sixteen traits describing plant stature, leaf characteristics and reproductive phase were recorded on the most abundant species of each treatment. These data were combined with species abundance to calculate trait values weighed by the abundance of species in the communities. The ecosystem properties selected were components of above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition of litter.
Key Results The wide variety of land-use systems that characterize marginal landscapes across Europe was reflected by the different disturbance indices, and were also reflected in soil and/or nutrient availability gradients. The trait toolkit allowed us to describe adequately the functional response of vegetation to land-use changes, but we suggest that some traits (vegetative plant height, stem dry matter content) should be omitted in studies involving mainly herbaceous species. Using the example of the relationship between leaf dry matter content and above-ground dead material, we demonstrate how the data collected may be used to analyse direct effects of climate and land use on ecosystem properties vs. indirect effects via changes in plant traits.
Conclusions This work shows the applicability of a set of protocols that can be widely applied to assess the impacts of global change drivers on species, communities and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Leaf mass per unit area ({LMA}) and internal leaf anatomy often affect net gas exchange because of their effects on internal {CO}2 conductance to the site of carboxylation, internal shading, competition for {CO}2 among carboxylation sites, nitrogen concentration and its partitioning. To evaluate effects of {LMA} and leaf anatomy on {CO}2 assimilation, water-use efficiency ({WUE}) and nitrogen-use efficiency ({NUE}), we measured {LMA}, leaf thickness, the thickness of mesophyll components, and gas exchange rates at ambient {CO}2 concentration in leaves of six woody deciduous and evergreen species with different leaf life spans. In two species, {CO}2 assimilation was also estimated at saturating {CO}2 concentrations.
There were interspecific differences in all morphological variables studied. Long-lived leaves had higher {LMA} and were thicker than short-lived leaves. Species with high {LMA} had low assimilation rates and {NUE}, both in ambient and saturating {CO}2 concentrations. Thus, in species with high {LMA}, assimilation was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, possibly because of a lower allocation of N to the photosynthetic machinery than in species with low {LMA}. Within a species, thicker leaves tended to have a lower tissue density. In intraspecific comparisons under field conditions, increasing internal air volume had positive effects on {WUE}, probably because of enhanced internal {CO}2 conductance to the site of carboxylation. We conclude that, in interspecific comparisons, different patterns of N partitioning strongly influence {NUE}, whereas in intraspecific comparisons, internal leaf anatomy is a key factor regulating resource-use efficiency.},

A pot experiment in a temperature-controlled greenhouse was conducted to investigate the effects of drought stress on biomass production, partitioning, and water use efficiency ({WUE}) of four genotypes of vegetable amaranth, viz. ‘Hin Choi’ (A. tricolor), ‘Co.2’ (A. tricolor), ‘{WS}80-192’ (A. blitum), and ‘{RRC} 1027’ (A. cruentus). Drought stress significantly decreased plant total dry mass, but the proportion of changes differed among root, stem, and leaf. Under drought, root dry mass ratio was increased in Co.2, {WS}80-192, and {RRC} 1027, whereas leaf dry mass ratio was decreased in Hin Choi, Co.2, and {RRC} 1027. Leaf area per root dry mass was decreased by drought stress in all genotypes examined. These results indicate that drought induced a more conservative balance between water-losing and water-obtaining organs. Specific leaf area ({SLA}) was decreased by drought stress and differed between genotypes. {WUE} of the four genotypes of vegetable amaranth was unaffected by drought stress, and ranged from 2.9 to 3.8 g {DM} kg−1 H2O, being the highest in {RRC} 1027 and the lowest in {WS}80-192. A negative relationship between {SLA} and {WUE} was observed over the four genotypes of vegetable amaranth under well-watered conditions.},

In general, ∂g/∂E is negative and constant so that the relation between g and E can be defined by two parameters: a maximum conductance gm obtained by extrapolation to zero transpiration, and a maximum rate of transpiration Em obtained by extrapolation to zero conductance. Both parameters are shown to be functions of temperature, {CO}2 concentration, and soil water content. Exceptionally, transpiration rate and conductance may decrease together in very dry air, possibly because of patchy closure of stomata.},

Gas-exchange characteristics of sun leaves growing at the top of a 30 m canopy and of shade leaves growing at a depth of 3–4 m from the top of the canopy were determined. Measured rates of net photosynthesis at a leaf temperature of 30°C and saturating photosynthetic photon flux density, expressed on a leaf area basis, were significantly lower (P = 0.01; n = 8) in shade leaves (7.9μmol m−2 s−1) than in sun leaves (11–5μmol m−2 s−1). Specific leaf area increased significantly with depth in the canopy, and when photosynthesis rates were expressed on a dry mass basis, they were not significantly different for shade and sun leaves. The percentage leaf nitrogen did not vary significantly with height in the canopy; thus, rates expressed on a per unit nitrogen basis were also not significantly different in shade and sun leaves. A widely used model integrating photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was parametrized independently for sun and shade leaves, enabling us to model successfully diurnal variations in photosynthesis and evapotranspiration of both classes of leaves. Key photosynthesis model parameters were found to scale with leaf nitrogen levels. The leaf model parametrizations were then incorporated into a canopy-scale gas-exchange model that is discussed and tested in a companion paper (Baldocchi \& Harley 1995, Plant, Cell and Environment 18, 1157–1173).},

In this study, we selected four perennial herbaceous species with contrasting resource-use strategies (acquisitive versus conservative), which were transplanted as monocultures into {PVC} pots to evaluate their species-specific responses to drought. The two main strategies of drought-survival (avoidance versus tolerance) were driven by distinct underlying mechanisms that allow the plant to delay or tolerate water deficit in leaves. On the one hand, plants that produced reduced leaves with lower surface area:mass ratio (lower {SLA}) exhibited higher values of leaf water potential ({LWP}) and leaf relative water content ({LRWC}), which could be associated to a higher ability to delay tissue dehydration in enlarged leaves. Regarding the below-ground compartment, dehydration avoidance was promoted by prolonged elongation rates of thinner roots that allow the plant to increase water uptake and accessibility during the dry period. On the other hand, dehydration tolerance was positively related with progressive foliage senescence under water deficit, which probably favored a longer survival of meristematic basal tissues. The results presented in this study suggest the existence of a trade-off between the traits favoring rapid light-acquisition and those enhancing the ability to delay leaf dehydration. Thus, the species related most closely with a resource-acquisition strategy (Bromus erectus and Potentilla neumanniana) could be considered less efficient to delay leaf dehydration than the others (Carex humilis and Festuca christiani-bernardii), as indicated by their lower values of leaf water potential ({LWP}) and leaf relative water content ({LRWC}) under identical conditions of water deficit. Our findings support evidence that there is not a single strategy to effectively cope with drought and reveal the diversity of adaptive mechanisms among coexisting species.},

Abstract
Increasing drought is one of the most critical challenges facing species and ecosystems worldwide, and improved theory and practices are needed for quantification of species tolerances. Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting (πtlp), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of πtlp and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that πtlp was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both πtlp and relative water content at turgor loss point ({RWCtlp}) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor (πo) and bulk modulus of elasticity (ε). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that πo is the major driver of πtlp. In contrast, ε plays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain {RWCtlp}, preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

At 37, 67, and 97 day after sowing ({DAS}), data were recorded for {SLA} and {SCMR}. Root dry weight, harvest index ({HI}) and {WUE} were recorded at harvest. Drought reduced {WUE}, root dry weight and {HI}.

The photosynthesis model has played a major role in defining the path towards scientific understanding of photosynthetic carbon uptake and the role of photosynthesis on regulating the earth's climate and biogeochemical systems. In this review, we summarize the photosynthesis model, including its continued development and applications. We also review the implications these developments have on quantifying photosynthesis at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and discuss the model's role in determining photosynthetic responses to changes in environmental conditions. Finally, the review includes a discussion of the larger-scale modelling and remote-sensing applications that rely on the leaf photosynthesis model and are likely to open new scientific avenues to address the increasing challenges to plant productivity over the next century.},

This review highlights selected examples in which substantial functional convergence among taxonomically, phylogenetically and architecturally diverse species has been revealed by applying appropriate scaling factors and identifying universal constraints or trade-offs. Recent empirical and theoretical scaling models emphasize the strong role that plant size, architecture, allometry and chemistry play in constraining functional traits related to water and carbon economy and growth. Taken together, the findings summarized here strongly suggest that there are a limited number of physiological solutions to a given problem of plant adaptation to the environment. Comparative ecophysiological studies will therefore benefit from consideration of the constraints that plant anatomical, structural and chemical attributes place on physiological functioning.},

	abstract = {Perennial grasslands provide numerous environmental benefits but their response to severe drought and therefore their sustainability in arid and Mediterranean areas have been little studied. Due to climate change, models of pasture production should be able to predict sward evolutions under increasing aridity. Our general goal was to identify plant traits and functional types that could be included in models aiming to analyse the dynamics of contrasting types of herbaceous plants grown in mixtures under drought. The two steps were: (1) to investigate the morpho-physiological traits associated with drought survival within a mixture of perennial herbaceous populations and to test whether the physiological traits measured under optimum conditions of growth in Spring may predict plant responses under subsequent summer drought and (2) to identify functional groups of populations exhibiting similar responses to the disturbance regime caused by severe drought. Seven different populations from five species were grown in monocultures (pots, long columns) and mixtures (containers, field). Standard leaf functional traits, aerial and root biomass were assessed under non-limiting water supply in Spring. In Summer, under continuous severe drought, leaf water status and plant survival were measured.

Senescence of aerial tissues at the end of Spring, associated with endogenous summer dormancy, water status maintenance in basal tissues during the intense drought, and root biomass in the field were the variables best correlated with drought survival. The standard leaf functional traits specific leaf area ({SLA}) and leaf dry matter content ({LDMC}) measured in Spring under full irrigation, were uncorrelated with drought survival. These results suggested no general trade-off between growth potential and drought survival. Under conditions of optimal production in Spring, correlations were established between functional traits and variables associated with aerial biomass productivity which discriminated the group of forage cultivars from the other genotypes. Under summer drought, four main functional types of genotypes were defined according to their strategy of water use and therefore contrasting survival and persistence. This typology will be used to base further modelling study aiming to assess the effects of increasing aridity on the stability and productivity of herbaceous swards on the long term.},

	abstract = {A life-history trade-off between low mortality in the dark and rapid growth in the light is one of the most widely accepted mechanisms underlying plant ecological strategies in tropical forests. Differences in plant functional traits are thought to underlie these distinct ecological strategies; however, very few studies have shown relationships between functional traits and demographic rates within a functional group. We present 8 years of growth and mortality data from saplings of 15 species of Dipterocarpaceae planted into logged-over forest in Malaysian Borneo, and the relationships between these demographic rates and four key functional traits: wood density, specific leaf area ({SLA}), seed mass, and leaf C:N ratio. Species-specific differences in growth rates were separated from seedling size effects by fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models, to repeated measurements taken on individuals at multiple time points. Mortality data were analyzed using binary logistic regressions in a mixed-effects models framework. Growth increased and mortality decreased with increasing light availability. Species differed in both their growth and mortality rates, yet there was little evidence for a statistical interaction between species and light for either response. There was a positive relationship between growth rate and the predicted probability of mortality regardless of light environment, suggesting that this relationship may be driven by a general trade-off between traits that maximize growth and traits that minimize mortality, rather than through differential species responses to light. Our results indicate that wood density is an important trait that indicates both the ability of species to grow and resistance to mortality, but no other trait was correlated with either growth or mortality. Therefore, the growth mortality trade-off among species of dipterocarp appears to be general in being independent of species crossovers in performance in different light environments.},

* 4These results are compared to those already published in the literature: the commonly reported result that interspecific variation in {RGR} is determined primarily by {SLA} is partly due to the low irradiance used in most experiments, and the relative importance of {SLA} and {NAR} changes depending on irradiance.

	abstract = {Specific leaf area ({SLA}) is a key functional trait reflecting the trade-off between resource capture and conservation, and has been identified as playing an important role in plant community assembly. Mechanistic models of community assembly state that the assemblage of species in a local community is controlled by environment filters operating on functional traits. We measured within- and among-species variation of {SLA}, and environmental conditions in a tropical cloud forest to explore how variation in this functional trait contributes to community assembly. {SLA} variation at the species level was also decomposed into alpha (within assemblage variation), and beta (across assemblage variation) values. {SLA} decreased with increasing solar irradiance (approximated using plant height) within the three study sites, and differed among the three sites both for within- and among-species comparisons. Mean plot {SLA}, accounting for both within and among species across the three sites, increased significantly in relation to air temperature but not local photosynthetic photon flux density and soil total phosphorus. Alpha {SLA} decreased with increasing solar irradiance within the three sites and beta {SLA} differed among the three sites. Our results clearly demonstrate that light and air temperature are key environmental factors involved in organizing plant species within and among communities in tropical cloud forests. The strong relationship between both intra- and interspecific variation in {SLA} and environmental conditions strongly confirms the role of trait variation in the assembly of plant species in tropical cloud forest communities via environment filtering related to light availability and air temperature.},

Leaf hydraulic conductance ({KLeaf}), carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), leaf mass per unit area ({LMA}) and the driving force for water transport from stem to leaf (ΔΨStem–Leaf) were characterized for leaves spanning three orders of magnitude in surface area and two orders of magnitude in lifespan.

During periods of leaf water loss, ΔΨStem–Leaf was relatively constant.

	abstract = {Leaf shrinkage with dehydration has attracted attention for over 100 years, especially as it becomes visibly extreme during drought. However, little has been known of its correlation with physiology. Computer simulations of the leaf hydraulic system showed that a reduction of hydraulic conductance of the mesophyll pathways outside the xylem would cause a strong decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf). For 14 diverse species, we tested the hypothesis that shrinkage during dehydration (i.e. in whole leaf, cell and airspace thickness, and leaf area) is associated with reduction in Kleaf at declining leaf water potential (Ψleaf). We tested hypotheses for the linkage of leaf shrinkage with structural and physiological water relations parameters, including modulus of elasticity, osmotic pressure at full turgor, turgor loss point ({TLP}), and cuticular conductance. Species originating from moist habitats showed substantial shrinkage during dehydration before reaching {TLP}, in contrast with species originating from dry habitats. Across species, the decline of Kleaf with mild dehydration (i.e. the initial slope of the Kleaf versus Ψleaf curve) correlated with the decline of leaf thickness (the slope of the leaf thickness versus Ψleaf curve), as expected based on predictions from computer simulations. Leaf thickness shrinkage before {TLP} correlated across species with lower modulus of elasticity and with less negative osmotic pressure at full turgor, as did leaf area shrinkage between full turgor and oven desiccation. These findings point to a role for leaf shrinkage in hydraulic decline during mild dehydration, with potential impacts on drought adaptation for cells and leaves, influencing plant ecological distributions.},

	abstract = {The water status of plant leaves is dependent on both stomatal regulation and water supply from the vasculature to inner tissues. The present review addresses the multiple physiological and mechanistic facets of the latter process. Inner leaf tissues contribute to at least a third of the whole resistance to water flow within the plant. Physiological studies indicated that leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) is highly dependent on the anatomy, development and age of the leaf and can vary rapidly in response to physiological or environmental factors such as leaf hydration, light, temperature, or nutrient supply. Differences in venation pattern provide a basis for variations in Kleaf during development and between species. On a short time (hour) scale, the hydraulic resistance of the vessels can be influenced by transpiration-induced cavitations, wall collapses, and changes in xylem sap composition. The extravascular compartment includes all living tissues (xylem parenchyma, bundle sheath, and mesophyll) that transport water from xylem vessels to substomatal chambers. Pharmacological inhibition and reverse genetics studies have shown that this compartment involves water channel proteins called aquaporins ({AQPs}) that facilitate water transport across cell membranes. In many plant species, {AQPs} are present in all leaf tissues with a preferential expression in the vascular bundles. The various mechanisms that allow adjustment of Kleaf to specific environmental conditions include transcriptional regulation of {AQPs} and changes in their abundance, trafficking, and intrinsic activity. Finally, the hydraulics of inner leaf tissues can have a strong impact on the dynamic responses of leaf water potential and stomata, and as a consequence on plant carbon economy and leaf expansion growth. The manipulation of these functions could help optimize the entire plant performance and its adaptation to extreme conditions over short and long time scales.},

We examined acropetal changes in anatomy, hydraulic conductivity and rates of gas exchange in five grass species (including C3 and C4 functional types). Both stomatal conductance and photosynthesis increased along all grass blades despite constant light availability. Hydraulic efficiency within the xylem remained constant along the leaf, but structural changes outside the xylem changed in concert with stomatal conductance. Stomatal density and stomatal pore index remained constant along grass blades but interveinal distance decreased acropetally resulting in a decreased path length for water movement from vascular bundle to stomate. The increase in stomatal conductance was correlated with the decreased path length through the leaf mesophyll. A strong correlation between the distance from vascular bundles to stomatal pores and stomatal conductance has been identified across species; our results suggest this relationship also exists within individual leaves.},

To study the {WUEi} in different almond (Prunus dulcis) genotypes, we measured stomatal conductance ({gS}), assimilation rate (A), transpiration, internal concentration of {CO}2 (Ci), and leaf hydraulic conductance normalized to leaf area in five mixed crosses of almond trees. For all measured parameters we observed the most significant differences between ‘Johnston’ × ‘Lauranne’ and ‘Nonpareil’ × ‘Lauranne’. Nevertheless, ‘Carmel’ × ‘Tarraco’ showed the highest {WUEi} among the five crosses. The significant correlations among {gS}, A, and Ci indicated that A was probably limited by both stomatal and non-stomatal parameters that might be affected by genotype variations. In another experiment, we selected three cultivars of a new set of almond cultivars (Nonpareil, Carmel, and Masbovera) in four replicates for measuring {gS} at field capacity. Meanwhile, using a cryo-scanning electron microscopic ({SEM}) method, we prepared some images from the internal structures of leaves collected from the same cultivars of almond trees. Results showed that ‘Masbovera’ leaves, in which post-venous hydraulic distance (Dm) was higher compared with ‘Carmel’ and ‘Nonpareil’, represented significantly lower values of {gS} rather than the two other cultivars. Comparing mesophyll anatomy and {gS} between these cultivars demonstrated that Dm and the density of mesophyll cells might indirectly affect {gS} in almond leaves. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that water relations, {WUEi}, and leaf anatomy in almond trees differed among genotypes.},

This knowledge provides insight into how plants have adapted to different environmental pressures, and will lead to better calibration of future vegetation–climate models. Location  The data set represents vegetation from 175 sites around the world. Methods  For more than 2500 vascular plant species, we compiled data on leaf mass per area ({LMA}), leaf life span ({LL}), nitrogen concentration (Nmass) and photosynthetic capacity (Amass). Site climate was described with several standard indices. Correlation and regression analyses were used for quantifying relationships between single leaf traits and climate. Standardized major axis ({SMA}) analyses were used for assessing the effect of climate on bivariate relationships between leaf traits. Principal components analysis ({PCA}) was used to summarize multidimensional trait variation. Results  At hotter, drier and higher irradiance sites, (1) mean {LMA} and leaf N per area were higher; (2) average {LL} was shorter at a given {LMA}, or the increase in {LL} was less for a given increase in {LMA} ({LL}–{LMA} relationships became less positive); and (3) Amass was lower at a given Nmass, or the increase in Amass was less for a given increase in Nmass. Considering all traits simultaneously, 18\% of variation along the principal multivariate trait axis was explained by climate. Main conclusions  Trait-shifts with climate were of sufficient magnitude to have major implications for plant dry mass and nutrient economics, and represent substantial selective pressures associated with adaptation to different climatic regimes.},

	abstract = {An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area–leaf lifespan ({LMA}-{LL}) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high {LMA} and long {LL}), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass–seed output ({SM}-{SO}) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The {LMA}-{LL} and {SM}-{SO} dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size–twig size ({LS}-{TS}) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

	abstract = {Which factors cause fast-growing plant species to achieve a higher relative growth rate than slow-growing ones? To answer this question 24 wild species were grown from seed in a growth chamber under conditions of optimal nutrient supply and a growth analysis was carried out. Mean relative growth rate, corrected for possible ontogenetic drift, ranged from 113 to 356 mg g−1 day−1. Net assimilation rate, the increase in plant dry weight per unit leaf area and unit time, varied two-fold between species but no correlation with relative growth rate was found. The correlation between leaf area ratio, the ratio between total leaf area and total plant weight, and relative growth rate was very high. This positive correlation was mainly due to the specific leaf area, the ratio between leaf area and leaf weight, and to a lesser extent caused by the leaf weight ratio, the fraction of plant biomass allocated to the leaves. Differences in relative growth rate under conditions of optimum nutrient supply were correlated with the soil fertility in the natural habitat of these species. It is postulated that natural selection in a nutrient-rich environment has favoured species with a high specific leaf area and a high leaf weight ratio, and consequently a high leaf area ratio, whereas selection in nutrient-poor habitats has led to species with an inherently low specific leaf area and a higher fraction of root mass, and thus a low leaf area ratio.},

In this study, we focus on two questions: (1) Do allocation trade-offs provide a sufficient basis for niche differentiation in succulent plant communities? (2) What is the relative importance of different forms of environmental variability on species diversity and community composition? We approach these questions with a generic, individual-based simulation model. In our model, plants compete for water in a spatially explicit environment. Species differ in their size at maturity and in the allocation of carbon to roots, leaves and storage tissue. The model was fully specified with independent literature data. Model output was compared to characteristics of a species-rich community in the semi-arid Richtersveld (South Africa). The model reproduced the coexistence of plants with different sizes at maturity, the dominance of succulent shrubs, and the level of vegetation cover. We analyzed the effects of three forms of environmental variability: (a) temporal fluctuations in precipitation (rain and fog), (b) spatial heterogeneity of water supply due to run-on and run-off processes and (c) ‘rock pockets’ that limit root competition in space. The three types of variability had differential effects on diversity: diversity exhibited a strong hump-shaped response to temporal variation. Spatial variability increased diversity, with the strongest increase occurring at intermediate levels of temporal variability. Finally, rock pockets had the weakest effect, but contributed to diversity by providing refuges for small species, particularly at low temporal variability. The model thus shows that spatio-temporal variation of resource supply can maintain diversity over long time scales even in small systems, as is the case in the Richtersveld succulent communities. Trade-offs in allocation provide the basis for necessary niche differentiation. By describing resource competition between individual plants, our model provides a mechanistic basis for the link from species traits to community composition at given environmental conditions. It thereby contributes to an understanding of the forces shaping plant communities. Such an understanding is critical to reduce the threats environmental change poses to biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {In landscapes subject to intensive agriculture, both soil fertility and vegetation disturbance are capable of impacting strongly, evenly and simultaneously on the herbaceous plant cover and each tends to impose uniformity on the traits of constituent species. In more natural and ancient grasslands greater spatial and temporal variation in both productivity and disturbance occurs and both factors have been implicated in the maintenance of species-richness in herbaceous communities. However, empirical data suggest that disturbance is the more potent driver of trait differentiation and species co-existence at a local scale. This may arise from the great diversity in opportunities for establishment, growth or reproduction that arise when the intensity of competition is reduced by damage to the vegetation. In contrast to the diversifying effects of local disturbances, productivity-related plant traits (growth rate, leaf longevity, leaf chemistry, leaf toughness, decomposition rate) appear to be less variable on a local scale. This difference in the effects of the productivity and disturbance filters arises from the relative constancy of productivity within the community and the diversity in agency and in spatial and temporal scales exhibited by disturbance events. Also, evolutionary responses to disturbances involve minor adaptive shifts in phenological and regenerative traits and are more likely to occur as micro-evolutionary steps than the shifts in linked traits in the core physiology associated with the capacity to exploit productive and unproductive habitats. During the assembly of a community and over its subsequent lifespan filters with diversifying and convergent effects may operate simultaneously on recruitment from the local species pool and impose contrasted effects on the similarity of the trait values exhibited by co-existing species. Moreover, as a consequence of the frequent association of productivity with the convergence filter, an additional difference is predicted in terms of the effects of the two filters on ecosystem functioning. Convergence in traits selected by the productivity filter will exert effects on both the plant community and the ecosystem while divergent effects of the disturbance filter will be restricted to the plant community.},

Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity. But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites.},

Abstract
The global decline of biodiversity caused by human domination of ecosystems worldwide is supposed to alter important process rates and state variables in these ecosystems. However, there is considerable debate on the prevalence and importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function ({BDEF}). Here, we argue that much of the debate stems from two major shortcomings. First, most studies do not directly link the traits leading to increased or decreased function to the traits needed for species coexistence and dominance. We argue that implementing a trait-based approach and broadening the perception of diversity to include trait dissimilarity or trait divergence will result in more realistic predictions on the consequences of altered biodiversity. Second, the empirical and theoretical studies do not reflect the complexity of natural ecosystems, which makes it difficult to transfer the results to natural situations of species loss. We review how different aspects of complexity (trophic structure, multifunctionality, spatial or temporal heterogeneity, and spatial population dynamics) alter our perception of {BDEF}. We propose future research avenues concisely testing whether acknowledging this complexity will strengthen the observed biodiversity effects. Finally, we propose that a major future task is to disentangle biodiversity effects on ecosystem function from direct changes in function due to human alterations of abiotic constraints.},

Understanding which plant strategies allow them to cope with these stresses may encourage the selection of species or genotypes better able to make the most of non-optimal growth conditions in grassland agrosystems.

To test which strategies allowed species to be more efficient under P and water shortages, we grew 13 Fabaceae species under four growth conditions in a greenhouse experiment that resulted from crossing two levels of both P and water availability.

Ten root functional traits were measured under the four growth conditions, including cross-sectional area occupied by aerenchyma, mycorrhizal rate, root hair length, and specific root length ({SRL}). We determined relations between species’ root trait values and their plasticity and response to P and/or water stress in terms of total biomass production and stress intensity.

Results showed that mycorrhizal rates were negatively related to biomass production in the four growth conditions. Long root hairs and high aerenchyma production were associated with high biomass production in growth conditions without and with P stress, respectively. Species with acquisitive strategies (high {SRL}) were less impacted by P and water stress than those with conservative ones (low {SRL}). Additionally, increased {SRL} and root hair length decreased the impact of P stress on species’ performances.

Results showed that grassland Fabaceae display a wide range of root functional strategies (i.e. root functional trait attributes and plasticity), which explain their performances under P and/or water shortage.},

	abstract = {Variation in leaf life-span has long been considered of ecological significance.Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life-span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns. Among all species, both mass- (A"m"a"s"s) and area-based (A"a"r"e"a) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life-span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P {\textless}.001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.70) than an area (P {\textless}.05, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass-based leaf nitrogen (leaf N"m"a"s"s) decreased (P {\textless}.001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.52) with leaf life-span, but area-based leaf N (leaf N"a"r"e"a) did not (P {\textgreater}.25, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area ({SLA}, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life-span. Decreasing A"m"a"s"s with increasing leaf life-span results from the impact of decreasing N"m"a"s"s and {SLA} on A"m"a"s"s. Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life-span was similar for broad-leaved and needle-leaved subsets of the data. These leaf-scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., {SLA}, N"m"a"s"s, and A"m"a"s"s) the quantitative relationship with leaf life-span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. A"m"a"s"s was a linear function of N"m"a"s"s (P .001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while A"a"r"e"a was not significantly related to N"a"r"e"a. These results suggest that the photosynthesis-leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis. Relative growth rates ({RGR}) and leaf area ratio ({LAR}, the whole-plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P {\textless} .001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). {LAR} was positively related to both {RGR} and A"m"a"s"s (r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and A"m"a"s"s and {RGR} were also positively related (r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P {\textless} .001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.72) and increased with A"m"a"s"s (P {\textless} .001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life-span and high leaf N"m"a"s"s, {SLA}, {LAR}, and A"m"a"s"s interactively contribute to high growth rates in open-grown individuals. These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed-canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low {LAR} as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P {\textless} .001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency ({ANPP}/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life-span or total foliage mass (P {\textless} .001, r{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing A"m"a"s"s, N"m"a"s"s, and {SLA}, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaf life-spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production ({ANPP}, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life-span. Extended leaf life-span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand-level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life-span. We hypothesize that co-variation among species in leaf life-span, {SLA}, leaf N"m"a"s"s, A"m"a"s"s, and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short-term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand-level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf life-span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as casually interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.},

	abstract = {Most plants show considerable capacity to adjust their photosynthetic characteristics to their growth temperatures (temperature acclimation). The most typical case is a shift in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis, which can maximize the photosynthetic rate at the growth temperature. These plastic adjustments can allow plants to photosynthesize more efficiently at their new growth temperatures. In this review article, we summarize the basic differences in photosynthetic reactions in C3, C4, and {CAM} plants. We review the current understanding of the temperature responses of C3, C4, and {CAM} photosynthesis, and then discuss the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis in each photosynthetic type. Finally, we use the published data to evaluate the extent of photosynthetic temperature acclimation in higher plants, and analyze which plant groups (i.e., photosynthetic types and functional types) have a greater inherent ability for photosynthetic acclimation to temperature than others, since there have been reported interspecific variations in this ability. We found that the inherent ability for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis was different: (1) among C3, C4, and {CAM} species; and (2) among functional types within C3 plants. C3 plants generally had a greater ability for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis across a broad temperature range, {CAM} plants acclimated day and night photosynthetic process differentially to temperature, and C4 plants was adapted to warm environments. Moreover, within C3 species, evergreen woody plants and perennial herbaceous plants showed greater temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis (i.e., the photosynthetic rate at high-growth temperature divided by that at low-growth temperature was close to 1.0) than deciduous woody plants and annual herbaceous plants, indicating that photosynthetic acclimation would be particularly important in perennial, long-lived species that would experience a rise in growing season temperatures over their lifespan. Interestingly, across growth temperatures, the extent of temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis was maintained irrespective of the extent of the change in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (T opt), indicating that some plants achieve greater photosynthesis at the growth temperature by shifting T opt, whereas others can also achieve greater photosynthesis at the growth temperature by changing the shape of the photosynthesis–temperature curve without shifting T opt. It is considered that these differences in the inherent stability of temperature acclimation of photosynthesis would be reflected by differences in the limiting steps of photosynthetic rate.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of {CO}2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment.

The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20–35°C), {CO}2 concentrations (10–90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5–3.7 {kPa}) and light intensities (100–2000 μmol m−2s−1).

The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux (λE) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the ‘big-leaf’ approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of λE and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and λE. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and {CO}2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and λE. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the {CO}2 concentration of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Despite that phenolics are considered as a major weapon against herbivores and pathogens, the primal reason for their evolution may have been the imperative necessity for their {UV}-absorbing and antioxidant properties in order for plants to compensate for the adverse terrestrial conditions. In dry climates the choice concerning the first dilemma (carbon gain vs. water saving) needs the appropriate structural and metabolic modulations, which protect against stresses such as high {UV} and visible radiation or drought, but reduce photosynthesis and increase oxidative pressure. Thus, when water saving is chosen, priority is given to protection (including phenolic synthesis), instead of carbon gain and hence growth. At the global level, the different choices by the individual species are expressed by an interspecific negative relationship between total phenolics and photosynthesis. On the other hand, the accumulation of phenolics in water saving plants offers additional defensive functions because these multifunctional compounds can also act as pro-oxidant, antifeeding or toxic factors. Therefore phenolics, as biochemical jokers, can give the answer to both dilemmas: water saving involves high concentrations of phenolics which also offer high level of defence.},

To what extent plants synchronize their resource capture strategies above- and belowground remains uncertain. Existing results of trait relationships between leaf and root showed great inconsistency, which may be partly due to the differences in abiotic environmental conditions such as climate and soil. Moreover, there is currently little evidence on whether and how the stringent environments of high-altitude alpine ecosystems alter the coordination between above- and belowground. Here we measured six sets of analogous traits for both leaves and fine roots of 139 species collected from Tibetan alpine grassland and Mongolian temperate grassland. N, P and N:P ratio of leaves and fine roots were positively correlated, independent of biogeographic regions, phylogenetic affiliation or climate. In contrast, leaves and fine roots seem to regulate morphological traits more independently. The specific leaf area ({SLA})–specific root length ({SRL}) correlation shifted from negative at sites under low temperature to positive at warmer sites. The cold climate of alpine regions may impose different constraints on shoots and roots, selecting simultaneously for high {SLA} leaves for rapid C assimilation during the short growing season, but low {SRL} roots with high physical robustness to withstand soil freezing. In addition, there might be more community heterogeneity in cold soils, resulting in multidirectional strategies of root in resource acquisition. Thus our results demonstrated that alpine climate alters the relationships between leaf and root morphological but not chemical traits.},

Species on dry and infertile soils converge towards higher {LMA}. It has been generally assumed that this allows species from low-resource habitats to achieve longer average leaf life spans, as {LMA} and {LL} are often correlated. 2 Leaf life span and {LMA} were measured for 75 perennial species from eastern Australia. Species were sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites within high and low rainfall regions. {LL} and {LMA} were positively correlated across species within each site. In addition, evolutionary divergences in {LL} and {LMA} were correlated within each site, indicating that cross-species relationships were not simply driven by differences between higher taxonomic groups. 3 Within a rainfall zone, {LL}-{LMA} combinations shifted as expected along common axes of variation such that species on poorer soils had higher {LMA} and longer {LL}, but significantly so only at high rainfall. 4 Low rainfall species were expected to have shorter {LL} at a given {LMA} or, equally, require higher {LMA} to achieve a given {LL}, i.e. shift to a parallel axis of variation, and this was observed on both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. On average, 30\% higher {LMA} was seemingly required at dry sites to achieve a given {LL}. Thus, convergence towards higher {LMA} has different consequences for leaf life span in dry and nutrient-poor habitats. 5 The broad shifts in {LL}-{LMA} combinations between site types were also seen when comparing closely related species-pairs (phylogenetically independent contrasts) occurring on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils (within each rainfall zone), and at high- and low-rainfall sites (at each soil nutrient level).},

Two congeneric grasses with contrasting light requirements, Dactylis glomerata and D. polygama, were used. The aim was to analyze phenotypic covariation in components of leaf area and root length in response to above- and belowground resource limitation and the consequences of this variation for resource acquisition and plant growth. At intermediate shading (30 and 20\% of full sunlight) the plants were able to maintain their total root length, despite a strongly increased total leaf area and a reduced biomass allocation to roots. This was associated with an unaltered or slightly increased nutrient uptake and growth. At 5.5\% relative irradiance, growth was severely reduced, especially in the shade-tolerant D. polygama. The results show that constraints on acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources, caused by biomass allocation, may be alleviated by plasticity in other traits such as tissue-mass density and thickness of roots and leaves. The results also suggest different adaptive constraints for phenotypic plasticity and for genetically determined interspecific variation. Phenotypic plasticity tends to maximize resource acquisition and growth rate in the short term, whereas the higher tissue-mass density and the longer leaf life-span of shade-tolerant species indicate reduced loss rates as a more advantageous species-specific adaptation to shade in the long term.},

We tested in a common garden experiment the performance of Pinus sylvestris seedlings from the continental Central Alps under increased temperatures and extended spring and/or summer drought, and compared seedling emergence, survival and biomass allocation to that of P. sylvestris and closely related Pinus nigra from a Mediterranean seed source. Soil heating had only minor effects on seedling performance but high spring precipitation doubled the number of continental P. sylvestris seedlings present after the summer drought. At the same time, twice as many seedlings of the Mediterranean than the continental P. sylvestris provenance were present, which was due to both higher emergence and lower mortality under dry conditions. Both P. sylvestris provenances allocated similar amounts of biomass to roots when grown under low summer precipitation. Mediterranean seedlings, however, revealed lower phenotypic plasticity than continental seedlings under high precipitation, which might limit their competitive ability in continental Alpine forests in non-drought years. By contrast, high variability in the response of individual seedlings to summer drought indicates the potential of continental P. sylvestris provenances to adapt to changing environmental conditions.},

However, since evolutionary and ecological selective pressures differ, individual and interspecific responses to drought might not match. We determined summer survival and a number of ecophysiological variables in two factorial experiments with seedlings of eleven tree species present in Mediterranean ecosystems, grown under slowly imposed water stress and control conditions. Plants experiencing drought exhibited reduced growth, low specific leaf area, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic rate when compared to the controls, and species-specific drought tolerance was associated with an analogous set of trait values. However, while species with high leaf area ratio and shoot-root ratio exhibited greater drought tolerance, drought induced the reversed response within species. Contrary to expectations, water use efficiency was lower in drought-tolerant species and decreased in water-stressed individuals compared to the control plants. There was a distinctive phylogenetic signal in the functional grouping of species, with oaks, pines, and other genera being clearly different from each other in their drought tolerance and in their functional responses to drought. However, all relationships between ecophysiological variables and drought tolerance were significant after accounting for phylogenetic effects, with the exception of the relationship between drought tolerance and photochemical efficiency. Our results show that drought tolerance is not achieved by a single combination of trait values, and that even though evolutionary processes and individual responses tend to render similar results in terms of functional traits associated with drought, they do not necessarily match.},

	shorttitle = {Optimizing nitrogen economy under drought},
	abstract = {Background and Aims The major objective was to identify plant traits functionally important for optimization of shoot growth and nitrogen (N) economy under drought. Although increased leaf N content (area basis) has been observed in dry environments and theory predicts increased leaf N to be an acclimation to drought, experimental evidence for the prediction is rare.
Methods A pedigree of 200 full-sibling hybrid willows was pot-grown in a glasshouse in three replicate blocks and exposed to two water regimes for 3 weeks. Drought conditions were simulated as repeated periods of water shortage. The total leaf mass and area, leaf area efficiency (shoot growth per unit leaf area, {EA}), area-based leaf N content ({NA}), total leaf N pool ({NL}) and leaf N efficiency (shoot growth per unit leaf N, {EN}) were assessed.
Key Results In the water-stress treatment, shoot biomass growth was N limited in the genotypes with low {NL}, but increasingly limited by other factors in the genotypes with greatest {NL}. The {NA} was increased by drought, and drought-induced shift in {NA} varied between genotypes (significant G × E). Judged from the {EA}–{NA} relationship, optimal {NA} was 16 \% higher in the water-stress compared with the well-watered treatment. Biomass allocation to leaves and shoots varied between treatments, but the treatment response of the leaf : shoot ratio was similar across all genotypes.
Conclusions It is concluded that N-uptake efficiency and leaf N efficiency are important traits to improve growth under drought. Increased leaf N content (area basis) is an acclimation to optimize N economy under drought. The leaf N content is an interesting trait for breeding of willow bioenergy crops in a climate change future. In contrast, leaf biomass allocation is a less interesting breeding target to improve yield under drought.},

	abstract = {* •Mediterranean-type ecosystems contain 20\% of all vascular plant diversity on Earth and have been identified as being particularly threatened by future increases in drought. Of particular concern is the Cape Floral Region of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, yet there are limited experimental data to validate predicted impacts on the flora. In a field rainout experiment, we tested whether rooting depth and degree of isohydry or anisohydry could aid in the functional classification of drought responses across diverse growth forms.
* •We imposed a 6-month summer drought, for 2 yr, in a mountain fynbos shrubland. We monitored a suite of parameters, from physiological traits to morphological outcomes, in seven species comprising the three dominant growth forms (deep-rooted proteoid shrubs, shallow-rooted ericoid shrubs and graminoid restioids).
* •There was considerable variation in drought response both between and within the growth forms. The shallow-rooted, anisohydric ericoid shrubs all suffered considerable reductions in growth and flowering and increased mortality. By contrast, the shallow-rooted, isohydric restioids and deep-rooted, isohydric proteoid shrubs were largely unaffected by the drought.
* •Rooting depth and degree of iso/anisohydry allow a first-order functional classification of drought response pathways in this flora. Consideration of additional traits would further refine this approach.},

	abstract = {Given that a plant's defensive strategy against herbivory is never likely to be a single trait, we develop the concept of plant defense syndromes, where association with specific ecological interactions can result in convergence on suites of covarying defensive traits. Defense syndromes can be studied within communities of diverse plant species as well as within clades of closely related species. In either case, theory predicts that plant defense traits can consistently covary across species, due to shared evolutionary ancestry or due to adaptive convergence. We examined potential defense syndromes in 24 species of milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) in a field experiment. Employing phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found few correlations between seven defensive traits, no bivariate trade-offs, and notable positive correlations between trichome density and latex production, and between C:N ratio and leaf toughness. We then used a hierarchical cluster analysis to produce a phenogram of defense trait similarity among the 24 species. This analysis revealed three distinct clusters of species. The defense syndromes of these species clusters are associated with either low nutritional quality or a balance of higher nutritional quality coupled with physical or chemical defenses. The phenogram based on defense traits was not congruent, however, with a molecular phylogeny of the group, suggesting convergence on defense syndromes. Finally, we examined the performance of monarch butterfly caterpillars on the 24 milkweed species in the field; monarch growth and survival did not differ on plants in the three syndromes, although multiple regression revealed that leaf trichomes and toughness significantly reduced caterpillar growth. The discovery of convergent plant defense syndromes can be used as a framework to ask questions about how abiotic environments, communities of herbivores, and biogeography are associated with particular defense strategies of plants.},

Hypotheses based on allocation theory and herbivore selection patterns predict that defense should increase or decrease, respectively, across ontogeny, and previous research partly supports both predictions. Thus, it remains unclear which pattern is more common and what factors contribute to variability among studies. We conducted a meta‐analysis of 116 published studies reporting ontogenetic patterns in plant defense traits and herbivory. Patterns varied depending on plant life form (woody, herbaceous, grass), type of herbivore (insect, mollusk, mammal), and type of defense trait (secondary chemistry, physical defense, tolerance). In woody plants, chemical defense increased during the seedling stage, followed by an increase in physical defenses during the vegetative juvenile stage. Mammalian herbivores showed a strong preference for mature compared to juvenile tissues in woody plants. Herbs experienced a significant increase in secondary chemistry across the entire ontogenetic trajectory, although the magnitude of increase was greatest during the seedling stage. Correspondingly, mollusks preferred young compared to older herbs. Future research investigating growth/defense trade‐offs, allometry, herbivore selection patterns, and ecological costs would shed light on the mechanisms driving the ontogenetic patterns observed.},

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the ‘leaf economics spectrum’, a similar ‘wood economics spectrum’ may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

This has resulted in development of functional–structural plant models ({FSPMs}). In {FSPMs}, the plant structure is always explicitly represented in terms of a network of elementary units. In this respect, {FSPMs} are different from more abstract models in which a simplified representation of the plant structure is frequently used (e.g. spatial density of leaves, total biomass, etc.). This key feature makes it possible to build modular models and creates avenues for efficient exchange of model components and experimental data. They are being used to deal with the complex 3-D structure of plants and to simulate growth and development occurring at spatial scales from cells to forest areas, and temporal scales from seconds to decades and many plant generations. The plant types studied also cover a broad spectrum, from algae to trees. This special issue of Annals of Botany features selected papers on {FSPM} topics such as models of morphological development, models of physical and biological processes, integrated models predicting dynamics of plants and plant communities, modelling platforms, methods for acquiring the 3-D structures of plants using automated measurements, and practical applications for agronomic purposes.},

	abstract = {Physiological and genetic studies of leaf growth often focus on short-term responses, leaving a gap to whole-plant models that predict biomass accumulation, transpiration and yield at crop scale. To bridge this gap, we developed a model that combines an existing model of leaf 6 expansion in response to short-term environmental variations with a model coordinating the development of all leaves of a plant. The latter was based on: (1) rates of leaf initiation, appearance and end of elongation measured in field experiments; and (2) the hypothesis of an independence of the growth between leaves. The resulting whole-plant leaf model was integrated into the generic crop model {APSIM} which provided dynamic feedback of environmental conditions to the leaf model and allowed simulation of crop growth at canopy level. The model was tested in 12 field situations with contrasting temperature, evaporative demand and soil water status. In observed and simulated data, high evaporative demand reduced leaf area at the whole-plant level, and short water deficits affected only leaves developing during the stress, either visible or still hidden in the whorl. The model adequately simulated whole-plant profiles of leaf area with a single set of parameters that applied to the same hybrid in all experiments. It was also suitable to predict biomass accumulation and yield of a similar hybrid grown in different conditions. This model extends to field conditions existing knowledge of the environmental controls of leaf elongation, and can be used to simulate how their genetic controls flow through to yield.},

Quantitative models that represent processes at multiple scales and link understanding from several research domains can help to tackle this problem. Such integrated models are more common in crop science and ecophysiology than in the research communities that elucidate molecular networks. Several laboratories have modeled particular aspects of growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, but it was unclear whether these existing models could productively be combined. We test this approach by constructing a multiscale model of Arabidopsis rosette growth. Four existing models were integrated with minimal parameter modification (leaf water content and one flowering parameter used measured data). The resulting framework model links genetic regulation and biochemical dynamics to events at the organ and whole-plant levels, helping to understand the combined effects of endogenous and environmental regulators on Arabidopsis growth. The framework model was validated and tested with metabolic, physiological, and biomass data from two laboratories, for five photoperiods, three accessions, and a transgenic line, highlighting the plasticity of plant growth strategies. The model was extended to include stochastic development. Model simulations gave insight into the developmental control of leaf production and provided a quantitative explanation for the pleiotropic developmental phenotype caused by overexpression of {miR}156, which was an open question. Modular, multiscale models, assembling knowledge from systems biology to ecophysiology, will help to understand and to engineer plant behavior from the genome to the field.},

	abstract = {The ability to assimilate C and allocate non-structural carbohydrates ({NSCs}) to the most appropriate organs is crucial to maximize plant ecological or agronomic performance. Such C source and sink activities are differentially affected by environmental constraints. Under drought, plant growth is generally more sink than source limited as organ expansion or appearance rate is earlier and stronger affected than C assimilation. This favors plant survival and recovery but not always agronomic performance as {NSC} are stored rather than used for growth due to a modified metabolism in source and sink leaves. Such interactions between plant C and water balance are complex and plant modeling can help analyzing their impact on plant phenotype. This paper addresses the impact of trade-offs between C sink and source activities and plant production under drought, combining experimental and modeling approaches. Two contrasted monocotyledonous species (rice, oil palm) were studied. Experimentally, the sink limitation of plant growth under moderate drought was confirmed as well as the modifications in {NSC} metabolism in source and sink organs. Under severe stress, when C source became limiting, plant {NSC} concentration decreased. Two plant models dedicated to oil palm and rice morphogenesis were used to perform a sensitivity analysis and further explore how to optimize C sink and source drought sensitivity to maximize plant growth. Modeling results highlighted that optimal drought sensitivity depends both on drought type and species and that modeling is a great opportunity to analyze such complex processes. Further modeling needs and more generally the challenge of using models to support complex trait breeding are discussed.},

Carbon (C) allocation was based on the concept of a functional balance between root and shoot growth, which responded to variable plant C and N supplies. Interactions between the plant and environment were made explicit by way of variables for soil water and soil inorganic N. The model was fitted to data on the growth of two species of perennial grass subjected to elevated atmospheric {CO}2and water stress treatments. The model exhibited complex feedbacks between plant and environment, and the indirect effects of {CO}2and water treatments on soil water and soil inorganic N supplies were important in interpreting observed plant responses. Growth was surprisingly insensitive to shoot-root partitioning in the model, apparently because of the limited soil N supply, which weakened the expected positive relationship between root growth and total N uptake. Alternative models for the regulation of allocation between shoots and roots were objectively compared by using optimization to find the least squares fit of each model to the data. Regulation by various combinations of C and N uptake rates, C and N substrate concentrations, and shoot and root biomass gave nearly equivalent fits to the data, apparently because these variables were correlated with each other. A partitioning function that maximized growth predicted too high a root to shoot ratio, suggesting that partitioning did not serve to maximize growth under the conditions of the experiment.},

	abstract = {• Background and Aims Physiological and architectural plant models have originally been developed for different purposes and therefore have little in common, thus making combined applications difficult. There is, however, an increasing demand for crop models that simulate the genetic and resource‐dependent variability of plant geometry and architecture, because man is increasingly able to transform plant production systems through combined genetic and environmental engineering.
• Model {GREENLAB} is presented, a mathematical plant model that simulates interactions between plant structure and function. Dual‐scale automaton is used to simulate plant organogenesis from germination to maturity on the basis of organogenetic growth cycles that have constant thermal time. Plant fresh biomass production is computed from transpiration, assuming transpiration efficiency to be constant and atmospheric demand to be the driving force, under non‐limiting water supply. The fresh biomass is then distributed among expanding organs according to their relative demand. Demand for organ growth is estimated from allometric relationships (e.g. leaf surface to weight ratios) and kinetics of potential growth rate for each organ type. These are obtained through parameter optimization against empirical, morphological data sets by running the model in inverted mode. Potential growth rates are then used as estimates of relative sink strength in the model. These and other ‘hidden’ plant parameters are calibrated using the non‐linear, least‐square method.
• Key Results and Conclusions The model reproduced accurately the dynamics of plant growth, architecture and geometry of various annual and woody plants, enabling 3D visualization. It was also able to simulate the variability of leaf size on the plant and compensatory growth following pruning, as a result of internal competition for resources. The potential of the model’s underlying concepts to predict the plant’s phenotypic plasticity is discussed.},

Leaf longevity is shown to maximize carbon gain through three parameters: leaf photosynthetic rate, the decrease in photosynthetic rate with leaf age, and the initial construction costs of the leaf. This theoretical approach has been extended to seasonal environments and effectively simulated the geographical pattern of leaf habits. To avoid self-shading, plants adopt two alternative modes of leaf emergence. One is successive leaf emergence, in which plants expand one leaf at a time on a shoot; this unshaded leaf utilizes full sunlight and is only replaced by a second leaf when its photosynthetic ability declines.

Les interactions entre la longévité, le comportement et le patron d'émergence des feuilles ainsi que l'architecture des tiges affectent la productivité de la plante.

Abstract
Despite the increasing importance of functional traits for the study of plant ecology, we do not know how variation in a given trait changes across ecological scales, which prevents us from assessing potential scale-dependent aspects of trait variation. To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

	abstract = {Linking functional traits to plant growth is critical for scaling attributes of organisms to the dynamics of ecosystems and for understanding how selection shapes integrated botanical phenotypes. However, a general mechanistic theory showing how traits specifically influence carbon and biomass flux within and across plants is needed. Building on foundational work on relative growth rate, recent work on functional trait spectra, and metabolic scaling theory, here we derive a generalized trait-based model of plant growth. In agreement with a wide variety of empirical data, our model uniquely predicts how key functional traits interact to regulate variation in relative growth rate, the allometric growth normalizations for both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and the quantitative form of several functional trait spectra relationships. The model also provides a general quantitative framework to incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships and hence to unite functional trait spectra with theories of relative growth rate, and metabolic scaling. We apply the model to calculate carbon use efficiency. This often ignored trait, which may influence variation in relative growth rate, appears to vary directionally across geographic gradients. Together, our results show how both quantitative plant traits and the geometry of vascular transport networks can be merged into a common scaling theory. Our model provides a framework for predicting not only how traits covary within an integrated allometric phenotype but also how trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth and carbon flux within and across diverse ecosystems.},

A frequently considered limit to the benefit of plasticity is that the environmental cues guiding plastic development can be unreliable. Such costs and limits have recently been included in theoretical models and, perhaps more importantly, relevant empirical studies now have emerged.

However, grazing is not considered in dynamic global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb, graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were modified by particular combinations of precipitation and history of herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identifies some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classifications for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that plant functional type classifications and response rules need to be specific to regions with different climate and herbivory history.},

The focus of this article is on integrating the different possible mechanisms by which functional diversity affects ecosystem properties that are directly relevant to ecosystem services. We propose a systematic way for progressing in understanding how land cover change affects these ecosystem properties through functional diversity modifications. Models on links between ecosystem properties and the local mean, range, and distribution of plant trait values are numerous, but they have been scattered in the literature, with varying degrees of empirical support and varying functional diversity components analyzed. Here we articulate these different components in a single conceptual and methodological framework that allows testing them in combination. We illustrate our approach with examples from the literature and apply the proposed framework to a grassland system in the central French Alps in which functional diversity, by responding to land use change, alters the provision of ecosystem services important to local stakeholders. We claim that our framework contributes to opening a new area of research at the interface of land change science and fundamental ecology.},

Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with ‘harder’ traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location:  central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization:  Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first {PCA} axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. {PCA} axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual {PCA} for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining {PCA} axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of ‘soft’ traits and ‘hard’ traits:  The validity of {PCA} axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors (‘hard’ traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. {PCA} axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on {PCA} axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion:  We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.},

The current method of ordinating plants according to these trade-offs, {CSR} classification, cannot be applied to the woody species that dominate many terrestrial ecosystems.


* We aimed to produce a novel {CSR} classification method applicable to vascular plants in general.


* Principal components analysis ({PCA}) of variation in a range of plant traits for 678 angiosperm, gymnosperm and pteridophyte species was used to determine the limits to multivariate space occupied by functionally diverse species. From this calibration, correlations between {PCA} axes and values of leaf dry matter content ({LDMC}; as an index of conservatism in life history), specific leaf area ({SLA}; indicative of acquisitive economics) and leaf area ({LA}; photosynthetic organ size) were used to produce predictor regressions from which target species could be compared against the multivariate space. A spreadsheet was developed that returned ternary coordinates and tertiary {CSR} strategies for target subjects based on {LA}, {LDMC} and {SLA} values.


* The method allowed classification of target species within a triangular space corresponding to Grime's theoretical {CSR} triangle and was sufficiently precise to distinguish strategies between species within genera and within populations of species. It was also largely in agreement with previous methods of {CSR} classification for herbaceous species.


* Rapid {CSR} classification of woody and herbaceous vascular plants is now possible, potentially allowing primary plant functional types and ecosystem processes to be investigated over landscape scales.},

	abstract = {* Dry matter digestibility is a critical component of herbage nutritive value, a major service delivered by grasslands. The aim of this study was to test whether the dominance hypothesis applies to assess the impacts of environmental gradients and management regimes on this component of herbage nutritive value in permanent grasslands.


* At the plant level, digestibility has been related to a number of functional traits, but whether this can be scaled up to the community level in species-rich grasslands and how such relationships are modulated by environmental conditions and management regimes remain unknown. Our primary objective was to test whether community-weighted means – species trait values weighted by the species abundance – of morphological, phenological and chemical traits could be used to explain variations in digestibility over a large range of climatic contexts, soil resource levels and management regimes. Our second objective was to explain variations in community digestibility within and among nine contrasting sites along large natural and man-induced environmental gradients.


* Over the whole data set, digestibility and most community-weighted means of traits responded to climatic factors and management regimes, but relations were not always significant when each site was considered separately. Community digestibility was significantly related to one or more plant traits within each site and to all of the measured traits when considering all the sites. Leaf dry matter content ({LDMC}) had the most consistent effects on digestibility, with a strikingly similar negative effect within each site. Potential evapotranspiration was negatively related to digestibility and contributed to explain a large part of the among-site variance. In addition, a low return interval of disturbance and a high disturbance intensity (biomass removal) were both associated with a high digestibility.


* Synthesis and applications. Disturbance regime, plant traits and local climate impacted dry matter digestibility roughly equally in grasslands. The effects of community composition on digestibility and its response to abiotic factors could be successfully captured by community-weighted means of leaf dry matter content. This functional marker can be used to develop indicators and grassland management rules to support farmers in the refinement of their practices towards specific needs, such as target production outputs.},

Photosynthesis, {SLA} and nitrogen partitioning within leaves was determined from 10 dicotyledonous C3 species grown in photon irradiances of 200 and 1000 µmol m−2 s−1. Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area measured under the growth irradiance was, on average, three times higher for high-light-grown plants than for those grown under low light, and two times higher when measured near light saturation. However, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf dry mass was unaltered by growth irradiance because low-light plants had double the {SLA}. Nitrogen concentrations per unit leaf mass were constant between the two light treatments, but plants grown in low light partitioned a larger fraction of leaf nitrogen into light harvesting. Leaf absorptance was curvilinearly related to chlorophyll content and independent of {SLA}. Daily photosynthesis per unit leaf dry mass under low-light conditions was much more responsive to changes in {SLA} than to nitrogen partitioning. Under high light, sensitivity to nitrogen partitioning increased, but changes in {SLA} were still more important.},

	abstract = {Functional diversity ({FD}) is a key facet of biodiversity used to address central questions in ecology. Despite recent methodological advances, {FD} remains a complex concept and no consensus has been reached either on how to quantify it, or on how it influences ecological processes. Here we define {FD} as the distribution of trait values within a community. When and how to account for intraspecific trait variability ({ITV}) when measuring {FD} remains one of the main current debates. It remains however unclear to what extent accounting for population-level {ITV} would modify {FD} quantification and associated conclusions. In this paper, we address two critical questions: (1) How sensitive are different components of {FD} to the inclusion of population-level {ITV}? (2) Does the omission of {ITV} obscure the understanding of ecological patterns? Using a mixture of empirical data and simulation experiments, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of four commonly used {FD} indices (community weighted mean traits, functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, Petchey and Gaston's {FD} index) and their relationships with environmental gradients and species richness, by varying both the extent (plasticity or not) and the structure (contingency to environmental gradient due to local adaptation) of population-level {ITV}. Our results suggest that {ITV} may strongly alter the quantification of {FD} and the detection of ecological patterns. Our analysis highlights that 1) species trait values distributions within communities are crucial to the sensitivity to {ITV}, 2) {ITV} structure plays a major role in this sensitivity and 3) different indices are not evenly sensitive to {ITV}, the single-trait {FD} from Petchey and Gaston being the most sensitive among the four metrics tested. We conclude that the effects of intraspecific variability in trait values should be more systematically tested before drawing central conclusions on {FD}, and suggest the use of simulation studies for such sensitivity analyses.},

	abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

Location
Eastern Morocco.
Methods
We measured relative abundance and functional traits along a short aridity gradient over two consecutive years at five heavily grazed sites, each with an exclosure preventing grazing. We analysed the relationship between aridity, grazing, and the expression of {CWM} trait values using ordination methods and a fourth-corner analysis.
Results
Unconstrained and constrained ordinations identified three distinct suites of temporally consistent functional traits that co-varied with aridity and grazing, and the fourth-corner analysis identified a number of significant but weak trait–environment associations. Grazing selected for short, fast-growing annual species with high {SLA}, high pastoral value and low seed mass, while aridity selected for species possessing succulent leaves with high δ13C leaf content, spines, low {LDMC} and short stature, although the relative importance of precipitation and grazing changed between years.
Conclusions
Although distinct from more mesic grasslands, our study sites exhibited patterns of trait correlations that were similar to the worldwide leaf economics spectrum. These correlation patterns represented three groups that were reminiscent of Grime's C-S-R model. Direct ordinations supported this interpretation. Temporal variation in our results was due in part to precipitation fluctuations. Our results also indicated selection for a grazing avoidance strategy under heavy grazing. Integrating plant functional traits in conservation and management of arid ecosystems represents a novel and challenging task to ensure more sustainable use of these lands.},

These responses can be captured by measuring key functional traits among and within species along important environmental gradients. Some anthropogenic changes (such as fertilizer runoff) are known to induce distinct community responses, but rarely have responses across natural and anthropogenic gradients been compared in the same system. In this study, we used comprehensive specific leaf area ({SLA}) data from a diverse Australian annual plant system to examine how individual species and whole communities respond to natural and anthropogenic gradients, and to climatically different growing seasons. We also investigated the influence of different leaf-sampling strategies on community-level results. Many species had similar mean {SLA} values but differed in {SLA} responses to spatial and temporal environmental variation. At the community scale, we identified distinct {SLA} responses to natural and anthropogenic gradients. Along anthropogenic gradients, increased mean {SLA}, coupled with {SLA} convergence, revealed evidence of competitive exclusion. This was further supported by the dominance of species turnover (vs. intraspecific variation) along these gradients. We also revealed strong temporal changes in {SLA} distributions in response to increasing growing-season precipitation. These climate-driven changes highlight differences among co-occurring species in their adaptive capacity to exploit abundant water resources during favorable seasons, differences that are likely to be important for species coexistence in this system. In relation to leaf-sampling strategies, we found that using leaves from a climatically different growing season can lead to misleading conclusions at the community scale.},

	abstract = {Understanding the influence of the environment on the functional structure of ecological communities is essential to predict the response of biodiversity to global change drivers. Ecological theory suggests that multiple environmental factors shape local species assemblages by progressively filtering species from the regional species pool to local communities. These successive filters should influence the various components of community functional structure in different ways. In this paper, we tested the relative influence of multiple environmental filters on various metrics of plant functional trait structure (i.e. ‘community weighted mean trait’ and components of functional trait diversity, i.e. functional richness, evenness and divergence) in 82 vegetation plots in the Guisane Valley, French Alps. For the 211 sampled species we measured traits known to capture key aspects of ecological strategies amongst vascular plant species, i.e. leaf traits, plant height and seed mass ({LHS}). A comprehensive information theory framework, together with null model based resampling techniques, was used to test the various environmental effects. Particular community components of functional structure responded differently to various environmental gradients, especially concerning the spatial scale at which the environmental factors seem to operate. Environmental factors acting at a large spatial scale (e.g. temperature) were found to predominantly shape community weighted mean trait values, while fine-scale factors (topography and soil characteristics) mostly influenced functional diversity and the distribution of trait values among the dominant species. Our results emphasize the hierarchical nature of ecological forces shaping local species assemblage: large-scale environmental filters having a primary effect, i.e. selecting the pool of species adapted to a site, and then filters at finer scales determining species abundances and local species coexistence. This suggests that different components of functional community structure will respond differently to environmental change, so that predicting plant community responses will require a hierarchical multi-facet approach.},

Methods Monocultures of 13 grass species, grown under field conditions and subjected to intensive management, were used to record root trait values for coarse roots (1st order, {\textgreater}0.3 mm), fine roots (2nd and 3rd orders, {\textless}0.2 mm) and mixed root samples over three growing seasons. Results Branching order and species had a significant effect on root trait values, whereas season showed a marginal effect. The diameter of coarse roots was more variable than that of fine roots and, as expected, coarse roots had higher tissue density and lower specific root length values than fine roots. Principal component analysis run on eight root traits provided evidence for two trait syndromes related to resource acquisition and conservation strategies across grass species. Conclusions Our data show that root branching order is the main determinant of root trait variation among species.

	abstract = {1. Functional traits have been extensively used to describe, group and rank species according to their functions. There is now growing evidence that intraspecific functional variability, as well as interspecific variability, can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. A core hypothesis for the use of functional traits expressed as species means, that their intraspecific variability is negligible compared with their interspecific variability, has however been too rarely tested empirically. We then addressed four questions: Is intraspecific functional variability across species ranges negligible compared with interspecific variability? Are the major resource economics trade-off and functional strategies robust to individual trait variability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species ranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be discriminated by their leaf traits? 2. Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine catchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant species with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations from a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each species across their ranges. 3. With an original combination of single-trait and multi-trait analyses, we highlighted a non-negligible contribution of intraspecific variability to overall functional trait variability (∼30\%). Although not affecting general and well-known functional trade-offs and strategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to alter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than a clear-cut species classification. 4. Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be considered as negligible – species being represented by mean trait values –, or not – species being represented by multivariate trait distributions –, is an essential question for multiple ecological issues. However, this decision cannot be generic, but will depend on the studied system and selected traits and species, as well as on study objectives.},

species 1 coexisted at similar abundance. The balance of
relative abundances diminished with the distance of
species 2 from this curve. For a given level of relative
species performances, coexistence stability increased
continuously as species differentiation increased. In
contrast to classical models that exhibit abrupt changes
of equilibrium community properties when species traits
vary, our model displayed continuous changes of these
properties in relation to the balance of life traits within and
among species. Intra-specific variability allows flexible
patterns of community dynamics and could explain
discrepancies between observations and classical theories.},

	abstract = {The study of interspecific variation in plant ecological strategies has revealed suites of traits associated with leaf life span and with maximum levels of water deficit (measured as leaf water potentials). Here, the relationship between these sets of traits was examined in a study of 20 co-occurring chaparral shrubs that vary in leaf habit, rooting depth, and regeneration strategies. Leaf life span ({LLS}) and minimum seasonal water potentials (ψmin) were not significantly correlated, suggesting that they are associated with independent aspects of functional variation. Multiple regression analyses of a large suite of physiological, functional, and phenological attributes in relation to these two “anchor traits” supported this view. Short {LLS} was significantly associated with high specific leaf area, high carbon assimilation and leaf nitrogen (per mass), early onset of growth, and a multistemmed, short stature growth form. This suite of traits was also associated with opportunistic regeneration following physical disturbance. Area-based gas exchange was not tightly linked to {LLS}. Low ψmin (i.e., greater water deficit) was associated with high wood density, small vessel diameters, thin twigs, low leaf area : sapwood area ratios, and early onset of leaf abscission. Among the evergreen species, this suite of traits was most characteristic of post-fire seeders, which depend on high drought tolerance for post-fire regeneration of seedlings. Plant stature was the only trait associated with both the {LLS} axis and the ψmin axis of functional variation. A two-dimensional strategy space, approximately defined by {LLS} and ψmin, can be used to distinguish contrasting strategies of drought tolerance vs. avoidance, and alternative modes of regeneration following fire and other disturbance. This conceptual scheme illustrates the strength of a trait-based approach to defining plant strategies in relation to resource availability and disturbance.},

	abstract = {* Studies of size-related plant traits have established a suite of mathematical functions describing whole plant investment and allocation. In parallel, studies of plant ‘economic spectra’ have measured the scaling and variance composition of traits related to the major dimensions of both structure and function. Here, we explore the intersection of these two broad areas by exploring the notion that many leaf economic traits are invariant with species differences in adult plant size. Invariant traits are those that do not change with plant size and are invoked as a key simplifying assumption of prominent models that purport to explain the scaling of plant size and metabolism. Unfortunately, leaf trait invariance is neither well defined nor understood and has never been critically evaluated.


* Using a global plant trait data set, we evaluated whether nine key traits can be considered as effectively invariant as a function of the maximum height of plant species, within and across plant growth forms and within and across broad taxonomic groups. We also examine the influence of habitat, biome and global spatial scales on the size-relative variance in plant functional traits.


* We suggest that while invariance is an intuitive concept, an objective statistical definition is elusive. Expanding on ideas drawn from the study of life-history invariants, we propose five criteria to identify traits that are effectively invariant, depending on the research question.


* We show that all studied ‘leaf economic spectrum’ ({LES}) traits approach invariance within and between herbaceous and woody plant groups, angiosperms and gymnosperms, and within most biome and habitat types. Individual leaf area, however, shows a modest increase with plant size, and there are significant shifts in the average {LES} trait values at a given plant maximum height, among the plant growth forms and taxonomic groups.


* Our results demonstrate that generally, {LES} traits show little interspecific variation with maximum plant height, which provides some support for attempts to model plants with ‘average’ leaf properties. Our work also highlights the need for a better understanding of the drivers of leaf size variation within and across individuals, functional groups, clades, biomes and habitats.},

The leaf economics spectrum ({LES}) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.



*
Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).



*
There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.



*
Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.



*
Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow’ plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {* Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that are measured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast.


* A variety of linear and nonlinear methods were used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in the most comprehensive data set.


* The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits.


* Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs whenever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining community assembly across different ecosystems.},

However, the improvement of these models requires a mechanistic understanding of how individual trees allocate biomass. This study introduces a new tree model ({BETTINA}) focusing on this issue. It is designed to investigate the response of trees in terms of biomass allocation patterns to environmental conditions. Additionally, it is suitable as a component of an individual-based mangrove stand model. {BETTINA} describes the plasticity of trees in growth patterns depending on their below-ground resource uptake. In contrast to the existing mangrove stand models, {BETTINA} focusses explicitly on the processes leading to variation in resource availability. Based on the physical principle of osmotic potential of solutions, the direct influence of salinity on plant water availability is considered. Allometric model parameters are not restricted to only the above-ground measures of trees’ traits (such as stem diameter and height), but also characterize below-ground biomass. Within {BETTINA} these measures are not limited to predefined empirical maximum values, but are the result of and depend on environmental conditions.

The model is suitable to explain allometric measures and relations in dependence on total plant size and environmental conditions (for now salinity and light), and has a great potential for a physiologically and physically based improvement of plant component related biomass estimations.},

We discuss plant hormones and cellular signaling pathways that control shoot branching and elongation responses to shade and root architecture modulation in response to drought and salinity. Because belowground stresses also result in aboveground changes and vice versa, we then outline how a wider palette of plant phenotypic traits is affected by the individual stresses.

However, it is not known whether these relationships reflect patterns of evolutionary convergence, or whether they are due to contrasting characteristics of major seed plant lineages. We reevaluated a published data set for these seven traits measured in over 100 species, using phylogenetic independent contrasts calculated over a range of alternative seed plant phylogenies derived from recent molecular systematic analyses. In general, pairwise correlations among these seven traits were similar with and without consideration of phylogeny, and results were robust over a range of alternative phylogenies. We also evaluated relationships between these seven traits and lamina area, another important aspect of leaf function, and found moderate correlations with specific leaf area (0.64), mass-based photosynthesis (0.54), area-based nitrogen (−0.56), and leaf life span (−0.42). However, several of these correlations were markedly reduced using independent contrasts; for example, the correlation between leaf life span and lamina area was reduced to close to zero. This change reflects the large differences in both these traits between conifers and angiosperms and the absence of a relationship between the traits within these groups. This analysis illustrates that most interspecific relationships among leaf functional traits, considered across a broad range of seed plant taxa, reflect significant patterns of correlated evolutionary change, lending further support to the adaptive interpretation of these relationships.},

We have analyzed the role of leaf traits (leaf lamina dry matter content, {LDMC}; leaf lamina N content, {LNC} and specific leaf lamina area, {SLA}) for the annual above-ground primary productivity ({ANPP}) and quality (pepsin-cellulase digestibility, crude protein content) for herbivores of 13 perennial C3 pasture grass species.
* 2These relationships were investigated over 2 years with monocultures grown in a fully factorial block design crossing the plant species, the cutting frequency and the N supply factors.
* 3The within species variation in leaf traits, {ANPP}, digestibility and protein content was less than between species variation. Species ranks for leaf traits were conserved among N supply and cutting frequency levels. Highly significant (P {\textless} 0·001) between species allometric relationships were found for {LNC} × {SLA} and {SLA} × {LDMC}, with common slopes but differences in intercept and shifts among factor levels.
* 4The between species variation in {ANPP} was strongly (P {\textless} 0·001) and negatively correlated with the fresh-matter based leaf N content (i.e. {LDMC} × {LNC}) and was not affected by {SLA}, apparently because of a trade-off between {SLA} and leaf lamina fraction. Digestibility increased with {SLA} and declined with {LDMC}. Protein content increased with both fresh and dry-matter based {LNC}.
* 5N supply increased {LNC} and {SLA} but reduced {LDMC}. Cutting frequency increased {LDMC} and reduced {LNC}. In response to cutting frequency, changes in digestibility and in fresh-matter based {LNC} were positively correlated.
* 6We conclude that the between species variation in the annual production of digestible energy and of proteins by pasture grasses is controlled in an additive way by two leaf traits: {LNC} and {LDMC}.},

Using a reciprocal transplantation experiment, we tested the response of five species to an elevational gradient. This was combined to a neighbour removal treatment to test the importance of local adaptation and biotic interactions. The trait studied was performance measured as survival and biomass. Species response varied along the elevational gradient, but with no consistent pattern. Performance of species was influenced by environmental conditions occurring locally at each site, as well as by positive or negative effects of the surrounding vegetation. Indeed, we observed a shift from competition for biomass to facilitation for survival as a response to the increase in environmental stress occurring in the different sites. Unlike previous studies pointing out an increase of stress along the elevation gradient, our results supported a stress gradient related to water availability, which was not strictly parallel to the elevational gradient. For three of our species, we observed a greater biomass production for the population coming from the site where the species was dominant (central population) compared to population sampled at the limit of the distribution (marginal population). Nevertheless, we did not observe any pattern of local adaptation that could indicate adaptation of populations to a particular habitat. Altogether, our results highlighted the great ability of plant species to cope with environmental changes, with no local adaptation and great variability in response to local conditions. Our study confirms the importance of taking into account biotic interactions and population structure occurring at local scale in the prediction of communities’ responses to global environmental changes.},

Methods Two species with contrasted resource-use strategies, Dactylis glomerata and Festuca paniculata, were grown along a productivity gradient in a greenhouse experiment. Functional traits of different genotypes were measured to estimate the relative roles of phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability, and to compare their levels of phenotypic plasticity.
Key Results Trait variability in the field for the two species is more likely to be the result of phenotypic plasticity rather than of genetic differentiation between populations. The exploitative species D. glomerata expressed an overall higher level of phenotypic plasticity compared with the conservative species F. paniculata. In addition to different amplitudes of phenotypic plasticity, the two species differed in their pattern of response for three functional traits relevant to resource use (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content).
Conclusions Functional trait variability was mainly the result of phenotypic plasticity, with the exploitative species showing greater variability. In addition to average trait values, two species with different resource-use strategies differed in their plastic responses to productivity.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Predicting the response of plant communities to variation in resources and disturbance is still a challenge, because findings depend on how ecological gradients are characterized and how grassland functional composition is assessed. Focusing on leaf dry matter content ({LDMC}), the efficacy of different methods for evaluating the best response of plant communities to either environmental or disturbance change is examined.
Methods Data were collected on 69 grasslands located at four sites in the Pyrenees and Massif Central. N-Ellenberg indices and plant nutrient content (Ni) were compared to assess fertility, and either {LDMC} (meas) measured or calculated from a trait database for which traits were measured under the same environmental conditions (db). Management regime ({MR}) was characterized in terms of categories (grazing, cutting) and plant height.
Key Results {LDMCdb} was positively correlated to {LDMCmeas}, but depended significantly on site temperature. N-Ellenberg and Ni were significantly correlated, and there was a significant effect of {MR} and temperature. {LDMC} responded to fertility, {MR} and temperature. Replacing {MR} by plant height in an {REML} analysis reduced the uncertainty of the {LDMC} prediction. {LDMC} was correlated to plant height at community level, whereas the correlation was weak at species level. Differences in {LDMC} between plant communities under any of the management regimes were significantly correlated to the standing herbage mass.
Conclusion The N-Ellenberg index is a better indicator of fertility than Ni which is short-term and environment-dependent. {LDMC} taken from a database allows plant trait variation due to species abundance (excluding variation due to trait plasticity in response to management) to be captured. So the former is better suited for assessing agricultural services that mainly depend on plant phenology and tissue composition. {LDMC} responded to defoliation regime in addition to fertility because plant height is roughly correlated with {LDMC} at plant community level.},

	abstract = {1. Trait-based approaches applied to community ecology have led to a considerable advance in understanding the effect of environmental filters on species assembly. Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation. 2. We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits – specific leaf area ({SLA}), leaf dry matter content ({LDMC}) and height – in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient. We quantified the contribution of intraspecific variability relative to interspecific differences in the trait–gradient relationship, and we used a null model approach to detect patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation, with and without intraspecific variability. 3. Community mean {SLA} and height varied significantly along the flooding gradient and intraspecific variability accounted for 44\% and 32\%, respectively, of these trait–gradient relationships. {LDMC} did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for {SLA} and height, but not for {LDMC}. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes. 4. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters. We argue that community ecology would benefit from more attention to intraspecific variability.},

	abstract = {1. Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values. 2. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories. 3. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic. 4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific functional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its recognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict ecological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are, however, required to compare inter- and intraspecific variability.},

Observations indicated shoots isometrically relates to roots at the community level but allometrically at the species level in Tibetan alpine grasslands. These differences may result from the specific complementarity of functional groups between functional components, such as leaf, root, stem and reproductive organ. To test the component complementary responses to regional moisture variation, we conducted a multi-site transect survey to measure plant individual size and component biomass fractions of common species belonging to the functional groups: forbs, grasses, legumes and sedges on the Northern Tibetan Plateau in peak growing season in 2010. Along the mean annual precipitation ({MAP}) gradient, we sampled 70 species, in which 20 are in alpine meadows, 20 in alpine steppes, 15 in alpine desert-steppes and 15 in alpine deserts, respectively. Our results showed that the size of alpine plants is small with individual biomass mostly lower than 1.0 g. Plants keep relative conservative component fractions across alpine grasslands at the individual level. However, the complementary responses between functional components to moisture variations specifically differ among functional groups. These results indicate that functional group diversity may be an effective tool for scaling biomass allocation patterns from individual up to community level. Therefore, it is necessary and valuable to perform intensive and systematic studies on identification and differentiation the influences of compositional changes in functional groups on ecosystem primary services and processes.},

Here, we investigate intraspecific trait variation of four grassland species along with abiotic environmental variation at high spatial resolution (n = 30 samples per species trait and environmental factor per site) in two contrasting grassland habitats in Central Apennines (Italy). We test for phenotypic adaptation between habitats, intraspecific trait-environment relationships within habitats, and the extent of trait and environmental variation. We considered whole plant, clonal, leaf, and seed traits. Differences between habitats were tested using {ANOVA} and {ANCOVA}. Trait-environment relationships were assessed using multiple regression models and hierarchical variance partitioning. The extent of variation was calculated using the coefficient of variation. Significant intraspecific differences in trait attributes between the contrasting habitats indicate phenotypic adaptation to in situ environmental conditions. Within habitats, light, soil temperature, and the availability of nitrate, ammonium, magnesium and potassium were the most important factors driving intraspecific trait-environment relationships. Leaf traits and height growth show lower variability than environment being probably more regulated by plants than clonal traits which show much higher variability. We show the adaptive significance of key plant traits leading to intraspecific adaptation of strategies providing insights for conservation of extant grassland communities. We argue that protecting habitats with considerable medium- and small-scale environmental heterogeneity is important to maintain large intraspecific variability within local populations that finally can buffer against uncertainty of future climate and land use scenarios.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Simple models of herbaceous plant growth based on optimal partitioning theory predict, at steady state, an isometric relationship between shoot and root biomass during plant ontogeny, i.e. a constant root–shoot ratio. This prediction has received mixed empirical support, suggesting either that optimal partitioning is too coarse an assumption to model plant biomass allocation, or that additional processes need to be modelled to account for empirical findings within the optimal partitioning framework. In this study, simulations are used to compare quantitatively two potential explanations for observed non-isometric relationships, namely nutrient limitation during the experiments and initial developmental constraints.
Methods A simple plant growth model was built to simulate the growth of herbaceous species, based on optimal partitioning theory combined with empirically measured plant functional traits. Its ability to reproduce plant relative growth rate and final root weight ratio was assessed against previously published data. Predicted root–shoot ratios during plant ontogeny were compared with experimental observations. The effects of nutrient limitation and initial developmental constraints on root–shoot ratios were then tested.
Key Results The model was found to reproduce overall plant growth patterns accurately, but failed, in its simplest form, at explaining non-isometric growth trajectories. Both nutrient limitation and ontogenetic developmental constraints were further shown to cause transient dynamics resulting in a deviation from isometry. Nitrogen limitation alone was not sufficient to explain the observed trajectories of most plant species. The inclusion of initial developmental constraints (fixed non-optimal initial root–shoot ratios) enabled the reproduction of the observed trajectories and were consistent with observed initial root–shoot ratios.
Conclusions This study highlights the fact that considering transient dynamics enables theoretical predictions based on optimal partitioning to be reconciled with empirically measured ontogenetic root–shoot allometries. The transient dynamics cannot be solely explained by nutrient limitation during the experiments, pointing to a likely role for initial developmental constraints in the observed non-isometric growth trajectories.},

* Dynamic global vegetation models ({DGVMs}) are powerful tools to project past, current and future vegetation patterns and associated biogeochemical cycles. However, most models are limited by how they define vegetation and by their simplistic representation of competition.


* We discuss how concepts from community assembly theory and coexistence theory can help to improve vegetation models. We further present a trait- and individual-based vegetation model ({aDGVM}2) that allows individual plants to adopt a unique combination of trait values. These traits define how individual plants grow and compete. A genetic optimization algorithm is used to simulate trait inheritance and reproductive isolation between individuals. These model properties allow the assembly of plant communities that are adapted to a site's biotic and abiotic conditions.


* The {aDGVM}2 simulates how environmental conditions influence the trait spectra of plant communities; that fire selects for traits that enhance fire protection and reduces trait diversity; and the emergence of life-history strategies that are suggestive of colonization–competition trade-offs.


* The {aDGVM}2 deals with functional diversity and competition fundamentally differently from current {DGVMs}. This approach may yield novel insights as to how vegetation may respond to climate change and we believe it could foster collaborations between functional plant biologists and vegetation modellers.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

	abstract = {* Despite widespread focus on interspecific variation in trait-based ecology, there is growing evidence that intraspecific trait variability can play a fundamental role in plant community responses to environmental change and community assembly.


* Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant communities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and subordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and community-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values.


* By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradient, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assemblages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abundance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P concentrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values.


* The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area ({SLA}) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species.


* The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and highlights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in community-level processes.},

For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental data of above-ground net primary productivity ({ANPP}) and plant community structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients. The Gemini model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance). Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced {ANPP} in monocultures and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that, along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundPlant} functional traits co-vary along strategy spectra, thereby defining trade-offs for resource acquisition and utilization amongst other processes. A main objective of plant ecology is to quantify the correlations among traits and ask why some of them are sufficiently closely coordinated to form a single axis of functional specialization. However, due to trait co-variations in nature, it is difficult to propose a mechanistic and causal explanation for the origin of trade-offs among traits observed at both intra- and inter-specific level.Methodology/Principal {FindingsUsing} the Gemini individual-centered model which coordinates physiological and morphological processes, we investigated with 12 grass species the consequences of deliberately decoupling variation of leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf lifespan) and plant stature (height and tiller number) on plant growth and phenotypic variability. For all species under both high and low N supplies, simulated trait values maximizing plant growth in monocultures matched observed trait values. Moreover, at the intraspecific level, plastic trait responses to N addition predicted by the model were in close agreement with observed trait responses. In a 4D trait space, our modeling approach highlighted that the unique trait combination maximizing plant growth under a given environmental condition was determined by a coordination of leaf, root and whole plant processes that tended to co-limit the acquisition and use of carbon and of nitrogen.Conclusion/{SignificanceOur} study provides a mechanistic explanation for the origin of trade-offs between plant functional traits and further predicts plasticity in plant traits in response to environmental changes. In a multidimensional trait space, regions occupied by current plant species can therefore be viewed as adaptive corridors where trait combinations minimize allometric and physiological constraints from the organ to the whole plant levels. The regions outside this corridor are empty because of inferior plant performance.},

We present a trait-based framework based on an empirical model to elucidate how climate change affects tradeoffs among {ESs}. Using alternative scenarios for mountain grasslands, we predicted how direct effects of climate change on ecosystems and indirect effects through farmers’ adaptations are likely to affect {ES} bundles through changes in plant functional properties. {ES} supply was overall more sensitive to climate than to induced management change, and {ES} bundles remained stable across scenarios. These responses largely reflected the restricted extent of management change in this constrained system, which was incorporated when scaling up plot level climate and management effects on ecosystem properties to the entire landscape.

	abstract = {Recent {IPCC} projections suggest that Africa will be subject to particularly severe changes in atmospheric conditions. How the vegetation of Africa and particularly the grassland–savanna–forest complex will respond to these changes has rarely been investigated. Most studies on global carbon cycles use vegetation models that do not adequately account for the complexity of the interactions that shape the distribution of tropical grasslands, savannas and forests. This casts doubt on their ability to reliably simulate the future vegetation of Africa. We present a new vegetation model, the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model ({aDGVM}) that was specifically developed for tropical vegetation. The {aDGVM} combines established components from existing {DGVMs} with novel process-based and adaptive modules for phenology, carbon allocation and fire within an individual-based framework. Thus, the model allows vegetation to adapt phenology, allocation and physiology to changing environmental conditions and disturbances in a way not possible in models based on fixed functional types. We used the model to simulate the current vegetation patterns of Africa and found good agreement between model projections and vegetation maps. We simulated vegetation in absence of fire and found that fire suppression strongly influences tree dominance at the regional scale while at a continental scale fire suppression increases biomass in vegetation by a more modest 13\%. Simulations under elevated temperature and atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations predicted longer growing periods, higher allocation to roots, higher fecundity, more biomass and a dramatic shift toward tree dominated biomes. Our analyses suggest that the {CO}2 fertilization effect is not saturated at ambient {CO}2 levels and will strongly increase in response to further increases in {CO}2 levels. The model provides a general and flexible framework for describing vegetation response to the interactive effects of climate and disturbances.},

An alternative explanation is based on nonlinear (allometric) allocation as a function of plant size. The objective of this study was to test between these two alternative explanations. 2. A total of 1150 plants from 22 different herbaceous species were grown in hydroponic sand culture in factorial combinations of high (1100 µmol m−2 s−1) and low (200 µmol m−2 s−1 {PAR}) irradiance crossed with a full-strength and a 1/6 dilution of Hoagland’s hydroponic solution. Plants were harvested at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 days postgermination, and dry mass was determined for leaf and root components. These data were used to test the hypotheses of balanced growth and of allometric allocation. 3. Both irradiance and nutrient supply affected the slope and intercept of the root : shoot allometry, contrary to the allometric hypothesis but in agreement with the hypothesis of balanced growth; decreased nutrient supply increased allocation to roots; and decreased irradiance increased allocation to leaves. 4. Plants allocated relatively more biomass to roots than to leaves as plants grew larger. In order for the balanced-growth hypothesis to be correct, the net rate of nutrient uptake per unit root mass must have been decreasing relative to the net rate of carbon gain per unit leaf mass. 5. We suggest two reasons why this might be the case: (i) older roots decreased their efficiency of nutrient uptake; and (ii) larger root systems more rapidly decreased the available nutrients between flushes of hydroponic solution. 6. These results support the notion of balanced growth that is found in many ecological models of plant growth.},

	abstract = {It has long been observed that leaf nitrogen concentrations decline with depth in closed canopies in a number of plant communities. This phenomenon is generally believed to be related to a changing radiation environment and it has been suggested by some researchers that plants allocate nitrogen in order to optimize total whole canopy photosynthesis. Although optimization theory has been successfully utilized to describe a variety of physiological and ecological phenomena, it has some shortcomings that are subject to criticism (e.g., time constraints, oversimplifications, lack of insights, etc.). In this paper we present an alternative to the optimization theory of plant canopy nitrogen distribution, which we term coordination theory. We hypothesize that plants allocate nitrogen to maintain a balance between two processes, each of which is dependent on leaf nitrogen content and each of which potentially limits photosynthesis. These two processes are defined as Wc, the Rubiscolimited rate of carboxylation, and Wj, the electron transport-limited rate of carboxylation. We suggest that plants allocate nitrogen differentially to, leaves in different canopy layers in such a way that Wc and Wj remain roughly balanced. In this scheme, the driving force for the allocation of nitrogen within a canopy is the difference between the leaf nitrogen content that is required to bring Wc and Wj into balance and the current nitrogen content. We show that the daily carbon assimilation of a canopy with a nitrogen distribution resulting from this internal coordination of Wc and Wj is very similar to that obtained using optimization theory.},

Our model predicts that the optimal leaf: root ratio and optimal photosynthetic capacity (Pmax) increase with soil N availability. For a given N availability, the optimal leaf: root ratio decreases and the optimal Pmax increases with increasing stem fraction. As a result, the increase in optimal leaf: root ratio is smaller, and that in optimal Pmax is greater, in response to increasing N availability when stem fraction is large. 3. To test these predictions we grew two herbs with different stem fractions: Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. and Chenopodium album L. Showing excellent agreement with the simulation results, the leaf N concentration and leaf: root ratio of the two herbs increased with increasing N availability, and leaf N concentration was larger for C. album with higher stem fraction than P. cuspidatum. 4. The general tendency for plants with larger stem fractions also to have greater leaf N concentrations and Pmax was demonstrated for a wide range of temperate herbs. This suggests that stem fraction may be a source of variation in Pmax among plants in the same functional group.},

* 2Four deciduous tree species and three herb species were grown under controlled conditions to test this hypothesis. Despite growing under the same soil N conditions, the {SAR} of these species differed more than sixfold, with the deciduous trees having a smaller {SAR} than the herbs. Consistent with the hypothesis, there were strong positive correlations between {SAR}, {LNC} and Pmax. Leaf dry mass per area and the {LNC}–Pmax relationship, factors correlated with leaf life span, differed little among the species, suggesting a small effect of differences in these properties on the variation in {LNC}.
* 3Simulations were performed using an optimal biomass allocation model and parameter values determined from measurements of each species. These demonstrated that the observed variation in {LNC} could be explained largely by differences in the N absorption ability of the species.
* 4Additionally, the causal relationship between N absorption ability and {LNC}, suggested by optimal biomass allocation models, was verified by manipulating the biomass allocation between roots and leaves of Morus bombycis using uniconazole, an inhibitor of gibberellin synthesis.
* 5These results indicate a close functional link between N absorption ability and {LNC}, which would account for large variations in {LNC} and Pmax across species.},

Population turnover, shoot and root morphogenesis, photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, N acquisition by uptake, allocation of assimilates between structural compartments, and reserve storage and remobilization, are simulated for each plant population. The object-oriented structure of the modeling framework allows to couple, or not, the simulated plant populations to other sub-models describing climate variables, soil functioning, grazing behavior and grassland management. Partitioning of growth between shoot structures, leaf photosynthetic proteins and roots is based on two assumptions: (i) functional balance between root and shoot activity, (ii) coordination of leaf photosynthesis. The model was parameterized from plant functional trait measurements of 13 native perennial pasture grass species grown in monocultures at high N availability and low cutting frequency in a field trial. Predicted and measured annual dry-matter yields were highly correlated without bias across species, N supply and cutting frequency treatments in monocultures and in mixtures of six species. Results show the ability of this mechanistic model to simulate without bias nitrogen and disturbance responses of net primary productivity and of plant community structure.},

	abstract = {• We tested the hypothesis that biological trait-based plant functional groups provide sufficient differentiation of species to enable generalization about a variety of plant ecophysiological traits or responses to nitrogen (N). • Seedlings of 34 North American grassland and savanna species, representing 5 functional groups, were grown in a glasshouse in an infertile soil with or without N fertilization. • Forbs, C$_{\textrm{3}}$ and C$_{\textrm{4}}$ grasses, on average, had similar relative growth rates ({RGR}), followed in declining order by legumes and oaks, but {RGR} varied greatly among species within functional groups. All measured attributes differed significantly among functional groups, of these, only {RGR} and photosynthesis differed among functional groups in response to N. All groups, except the legumes, had significantly greater photosynthetic and respiration rates at elevated N supply. Principal components analyses and cluster analyses yielded groupings that corresponded only moderately well to the biologically based a priori functional groupings. • Variation in {RGR} among species and treatments was positively related to net {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) and net assimilation rate, but unrelated to leaf area ratio. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were related to tissue \%N among treatments and species. Our data indicate that {RGR} and related traits differ among the functional groups in significant ways, but in a complex pattern that does not yield simple generalizations about relative performance, controls on {RGR}, or response to resource supply rate.},

	abstract = {A leaf-height-seed ({LHS}) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area {SLA} (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes. The advantages of the {LHS} scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's {CSR} scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The {CSR} triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C–S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the {LHS} scheme, {SLA} reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the {LHS} scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the {CSR} triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. {LHS} does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the {LHS} scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region. The {LHS} scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the {CSR} scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the {CSR} triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance. The advantage of {LHS} axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as {CSR}'s multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the {LHS} scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the {LHS} axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where {CSR} opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while {CSR} proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.},

	abstract = {Standardised procedures have been used to measure 67 traits in 43 common plants of the British flora. This paper provides an interpretation of the most consistent patterns in the resulting matrix by means of correlation, ordination and classification analyses. Only a weak coupling was observed between attributes of the regenerative and established phases of the life history. However, within each phase, attributes were strongly aggregated into sets and a high proportion of the variation between species coincided with a single axis. Attributes of the established phase displayed remarkably consistent trends, with a strong 'Axis 1' being identified by three different multivariate methods. There was a marked correlation between foliar concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, high concentrations of which coincided with the capacity for rapid growth in productive conditions and an inability to sustain yield under limiting supplies of nutrients. A diverse array of other traits, less immediately involving mineral nutrients, were also entrained in Axis 1; these included life history, root and shoot foraging, the morphology, longevity, tensile strength and palatability of leaves, and the decomposition rate of leaf litter. This pattern occurred in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons and appeared to reflect a tradeoff between attributes conferring an ability for high rates of resource acquisition in productive habitats and those responsible for retention of resource capital in unproductive conditions. The second axis of variation evident in the established phase was related to phylogeny and distinguished between monocotyledons and dicotyledons on the basis of a diverse set of traits including genome size, cell size, root and shoot foraging characteristics and vascular tissues. A third axis was detected in which ephemerals and perennials were separated by differences in attributes such as breeding system, leaf decomposition rate and a set of traits reflecting the small stature of many short-lived plants. In the regenerative phase, the leading axis was clearly related to the widely recognised tradeoff between seed size and seed number and was consistent with current understanding of seed banks, and with modern theories explaining species coexistence in terms of complementary responses to temporal and spatial variation in vegetation gap dynamics. The data provide strong evidence of functional integration between evolutionary specialisations in root and shoot and support Donald's unified theory of competitive ability. The data are not consistent with theories of functional types based upon evolutionary tradeoffs in allocation between root and shoot. We suggest that the evidence assembled here and elsewhere in the current literature points to the existence of primary functional types, including those recognised by Ramenskii and Grime. These functional types can be reconciled with the individuality of plant ecologies in the field and provide an effective basis for interpretation and prediction at various scales from the plant community to regional floras. There are particular opportunities for prediction of successional trajectories, the role of herbivores in vegetation succession and the response of vegetation to eutrophication and extreme climatic events. It is also suggested that aspects of this investigation may provide a Darwinian underpinning for Odum's theory of ecosystem maturation.},

	abstract = {Due to the difficulty to link dynamically and mechanistically the composition, the structure and the individual functions of grassland ecosystem, the ecosystem functioning remains unclear, which limits the prediction of ecosystem response to climatic and management changes. Plant functional traits are proposed as useful tool to link community response to environmental change and consecutive effect on ecosystem functioning. Plant functional trait is morphological, physiological, chemical and phenological characteristic of a plant, which can be transposed to organisation levels of species and community. This thesis deals with traits utilisation in a mechanistic modelling approach in order to link dynamically this hierarchy of organisation levels and, consequently, community response and ecosystem functioning. We used the functional traits of 13 grass species coocurring in mesic grassland, in a biogeochemical model of grassland diversity, {GEMINI} (Grassland Ecosystem Model with {INdividual} centered Interactions). This model has been developed, calibrated and used to understand the role of plant traits for the response of these species to two cut frequencies and two N fertilisation levels in monocultures and in mixtures in terms of productivity, plasticity and abundance. In first time, a model hypothesis concerning the leaf C:N stoichiometry has been validated. This leaf photosynthesis coordination hypothesis states a co-limitation of photosynthesis by light-driven and dark biochemical reactions. It has been tested by using a database of 31 species belonging to 6 plant functional groups and growing in different environmental conditions. This hypothesis explained without bias 92\% of total variance of leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area by the variations of three leaf photosynthetic traits. The model equations of substrates allocation between leaf structures and leaf photosynthetic proteins are therefore validated and calibrated. In second time, functional traits linked to root N acquisition and shoot N utilisation (N productivity efficiency and N residence time in tissue) have been measured in field monoculture on 13 species. We showed mechanistically the fundamental relationships linking root and shoot traits (size vs physiological activity specialization axes). Moreover, we highlighted interspecific trade-offs between: i) the root uptake capacities of {NO}3 - and {NH}4 + and ii) root area developed in resource patch and root N uptake. These results allowed the integration of root and leaf traits implied in N plant strategies in the calibration of {GEMINI} for each grass species. Once the model development completed, the simulations showed several emergent properties: 1) after defoliation and nitrogen deprivation, the plastic adjustments of relative size of structural compartments and of their physiological activities restore the functional balance leading to a colimitation of plant by light, nitrogen and {CO}2; 2) at equilibrium state, the size and the tiller density simulated by the model covary according to a -3/4 power coefficient. The model allows the simulation of vegetative production variations between species and between two cut frequencies and two N fertilisation levels both in monocultures and in mixtures. The observed ranks of grasses relative abundance are well predicted in different six species mixtures. Finally, the model simulates a positive biodiversity effect on the production of 6 species mixtures, which overproduce in comparison of each species in monoculture with the same initial tiller density. When the model is simplified, its prediction ability is degraded. The actual version of the model gives interesting perspective in terms of fundamental question in community ecology and in functional ecology. We provide an application example by investigating the origin of covariations between morphological traits observed in natura. For four traits representative of functional strategies of 13 grass species, a systematic study in 4D space built by these traits showed that: 1) the measured traits value maximizes the simulated growth for each of these species; 2) the individual plasticity observed in response to N deprivation maximizes the simulated growth. These results increases the understanding about the constraints imposed by intra-and-inter-specific trade-offs on the performance and the plasticity of these grass species across resource gradients.},

Particularly, it is unclear how the co-variations between size- and physiology-related traits determine N acquisition and N utilization at the plant scale.
* 2We used 13 co-occurring temperate pasture grasses to study inter-specific variations in above-ground N yield and in root N acquisition and shoot N utilization traits. N acquisition traits concerned root influx capacities for  and , root mass and specific root area in ingrowth cores. N utilization traits concerned leaf life span, leaf N content, leaf N resorption, mean residence time of N and leaf N use efficiency.
* 3We found evidence for three trade-offs across species concerning root N acquisition: (i) root mass increased when specific root area declined; (ii) an increase in root area was observed when total N influx capacity decreased; and (iii)  root influx capacity increased when  capacity declined.
* 4High total root uptake capacity gave rise to high leaf N content and was associated across species to low leaf N use efficiency. Tall grasses were characterized by high shoot N yield, high root biomass and high leaf N use efficiency. Physiology-related traits and size-related traits were generally found independent.
* 5Our study demonstrates how size and N uptake related root traits are associated to major axes of plant specialization ((i) plant size and (ii) conservation vs. exploitation of N) which were previously identified based on shoot traits. Contrasted N strategies were segregated across species according to four combinations along these two axes.},

The modeled growth of tree seedlings reproduced natural patterns accurately, including subtle ontogenetic shifts and environmental responses. The underlying processes of resource acquisition also behaved realistically, including the key process of stomatal control. Due to its holistic approach and the generality of the tradeoffs on which it is based, the model is well suited to investigating both general laws governing alternative designs for tree seedlings and the nature of trait adaptation in response to competition and environmental differences.},

	abstract = {Continental-scale assessments of 21st century global impacts of climate change on biodiversity have forecasted range contractions for many species. These coarse resolution studies are, however, of limited relevance for projecting risks to biodiversity in mountain systems, where pronounced microclimatic variation could allow species to persist locally, and are ill-suited for assessment of species-specific threat in particular regions. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges, using high-resolution (ca. 100 m) species samples and data expressing four future climate scenarios. Projected habitat loss is greater for species distributed at higher elevations; depending on the climate scenario, we find 36–55\% of alpine species, 31–51\% of subalpine species and 19–46\% of montane species lose more than 80\% of their suitable habitat by 2070–2100. While our high-resolution analyses consistently indicate marked levels of threat to cold-adapted mountain florae across Europe, they also reveal unequal distribution of this threat across the various mountain ranges. Impacts on florae from regions projected to undergo increased warming accompanied by decreased precipitation, such as the Pyrenees and the Eastern Austrian Alps, will likely be greater than on florae in regions where the increase in temperature is less pronounced and rainfall increases concomitantly, such as in the Norwegian Scandes and the Scottish Highlands. This suggests that change in precipitation, not only warming, plays an important role in determining the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation.},

	abstract = {* Climate change is expected to increase the magnitude and the frequency of extreme climatic events such as droughts. Better understanding how plant communities will respond to these droughts is a major challenge. We expect the response to be a shift in functional trait values resulting from both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, but little research has addressed the relative contribution of both components.

* We analysed the short-term functional response of subalpine grassland communities to a simulated drought by focusing on four leaf traits ({LDMC}: leaf dry matter content, {SLA}: specific leaf area, {LNC}: leaf nitrogen concentration and {LCC}: leaf carbon concentration). After evaluating species turnover and intraspecific variability separately, we determined their relative contribution in the community functional response to drought, reflected by changes in community-weighted mean traits.

* We found significant species turnover and intraspecific variability, as well as significant changes in community-weighted mean for most of the traits. The relative contribution of intraspecific variability to the changes in community mean traits was more important (42–99\%) than the relative contribution of species turnover (1–58\%). Intraspecific variability either amplified (for {LDMC}, {SLA} and {LCC}) or dampened (for {LNC}) the community functional response mediated by species turnover. We demonstrated that the small contribution of species turnover to the changes in community mean {LDMC} and {LCC} was explained by a lack of covariation between species turnover and interspecific trait differences.

* Synthesis. These results highlight the need for a better consideration of intraspecific variability to understand and predict the effect of climate change on plant communities. While both species turnover and intraspecific variability can be expected following an extreme drought, we report new evidence that intraspecific variability can be a more important driver of the short-term functional response of plant communities.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary community ecology is an emerging field of study that includes evolutionary principles such as individual trait variation and plasticity of traits to provide a more mechanistic insight as to how species diversity is maintained and community processes are shaped across time and space. In this review we explore phenotypic plasticity in functional traits and its consequences at the community level. We argue that resource requirement and resource uptake are plastic traits that can alter fundamental and realised niches of species in the community if environmental conditions change. We conceptually add to niche models by including phenotypic plasticity in traits involved in resource allocation under stress. Two qualitative predictions that we derive are: (1) plasticity in resource requirement induced by availability of resources enlarges the fundamental niche of species and causes a reduction of vacant niches for other species and (2) plasticity in the proportional resource uptake results in expansion of the realized niche, causing a reduction in the possibility for coexistence with other species. We illustrate these predictions with data on the competitive impact of invasive species. Furthermore, we review the quickly increasing number of empirical studies on evolutionary community ecology and demonstrate the impact of phenotypic plasticity on community composition. Among others, we give examples that show that differences in the level of phenotypic plasticity can disrupt species interactions when environmental conditions change, due to effects on realized niches. Finally, we indicate several promising directions for future phenotypic plasticity research in a community context. We need an integrative, trait-based approach that has its roots in community and evolutionary ecology in order to face fast changing environmental conditions such as global warming and urbanization that pose ecological as well as evolutionary challenges.},

	abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

	abstract = {* 1Our goal was to determine the relationships among ecophysiological, whole-plant and ecosystem traits of a wide variety of grassland species grown under field conditions in the long term. We measured 87 traits for 33 species (32 perennial, one annual) grown in monoculture for 5 years on sandy soils, and determined the relationship among traits and their correspondence with current functional classifications.
* 2Among non-legumes, species that produced and maintained large amounts of biomass had tough, low-activity leaves and roots, high root : shoot ratios, and low extractable inorganic nitrogen and N mineralization in their soils. The set of correlations among the functional traits of fine roots for non-legumes parallels the set of correlations for leaf functional traits. Low-N species maintained greater biomass than high-N species, more by producing tissues with low N concentrations and greater longevity than by acquiring more N. Greater relative production below ground, and the production of long-lived below-ground structures, were both important in determining the high root : shoot ratio of species.
* 3For legumes, N2 fixation not only led to greater above-ground biomass production, but also was associated with low fine root production; greater relative production of stem biomass; and accelerated ecosystem N cycling compared to non-legumes.
* 4The measured traits, as condensed via principal components analysis, differentiated the 32 species into groups that corresponded with a common grassland functional classification scheme (C3 grasses, C4 grasses, forbs, legumes, woody species) as well as an alternative, continuous approach. For all traits, species can be arrayed well along two continuous axes. The first axis separates cool-season and warm-season legumes; the second low-N and high-N non-legumes.
* 5These continuous classifications show the generality of the two strategies for dealing with low nitrogen availability (N2 fixation and the low-N suite of traits) and extends the strategies to span organ-level traits to ecosystem processes including roots, whole-plant patterns of productivity, and nutrient cycling. The correlations of traits among species will also be useful in predicting a large number of important parameters associated with plant growth from the measurement of a few, key traits.},

Prolonged summer droughts in the mid-term future, as are predicted for Central Europe, are expected to have a major impact on such ecosystems. To address this topic, rainfall exclusion via shelters was performed on three grassland sites at different altitudes (393, 982 and 1978 m above sea level) in Switzerland. Diurnal drought treatment effects were studied at each study site on a completely sunny day towards the end of an 8–10 week shelter period. Ecophysiological parameters including gas exchange (An, gs and intrinsic {WUE}) and chlorophyll a fluorescence (Fv/Fm, Φ{PSII} and {NPQ}) were considered for several species. The lowland and the Alpine field site were more strongly affected by soil drought than the pre-Alpine site. At all sites, grasses showed different patterns of reductions in stomatal conductance under soil drought compared to legumes and forbs. In addition, grasses were significantly more affected by reductions in assimilation rates at all sites. Time courses of reductions in assimilation rates relative to controls differed between species at the Alpine site, as some species showed reduced assimilation rates at this site in the early morning. Thus, similar rainfall exclusion treatments can trigger different reactions in various species at different sites, which might not become obvious during mere midday measurements. Overall, results suggest strong impacts of prolonged summer drought on grassland net photosynthesis especially at the Alpine site and, within sites, for grasses},

Summary
We quantified the biomass allocation patterns to leaves, stems and roots in vegetative plants, and how this is influenced by the growth environment, plant size, evolutionary history and competition. Dose–response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves ({LMF}) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the {LMF}-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on {LMF} more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in {LMF} is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio ({SLA}). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology.},

	abstract = {In grasslands, sustained nitrogen loading would increase the proportion of assimilated carbon allocated to shoot growth (A shoot), because it would decrease allocation to roots and also encourage the contribution of species with inherently high A shoot. However, in situ measurements of carbon allocation are scarce. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent species that coexist in grasslands actually differ in their allocation strategy or in their response to nitrogen. We used a mobile facility to perform steady-state 13C-labeling of field stands to quantify, in winter and autumn, the daily relative photosynthesis rate ({RPR}{\textasciitilde}tracer assimilated over one light-period) and A shoot ({\textasciitilde}tracer remaining in shoots after a 100 degree days chase period) in four individual species with contrasting morpho-physiological characteristics coexisting in a temperate grassland of Argentina, either fertilized or not with nitrogen, and either cut intermittently or grazed continuously. Plasticity in response to nitrogen was substantial in most species, as indicated by positive correlations between A shoot and shoot nitrogen concentration. There was a notable interspecific difference: productive species with higher {RPR}, enhanced by fertilization and characterized by faster leaf turnover rate, allocated {\textasciitilde}20 \% less of the assimilated carbon to shoot growth than species of lower productivity (and quality) characterized by longer leaf life spans and phyllochrons. These results imply that, opposite to the expected response, sustained nitrogen loading would change little the A shoot of grassland communities if increases at the species-level are offset by decreases associated with replacement of ‘low {RPR}-high A shoot’ species by ‘high {RPR}-low A shoot’ species.},

* Using in situ 13CO2 pulse labeling, we studied the effects of 1 wk of shading on the transfer of recent photoassimilates between sugars and starch of above- and belowground plant organs and to soil microbial communities of a mountain meadow.


* C allocation to roots and microbial communities was rapid. Shading strongly reduced sucrose and starch concentrations in shoots, but not roots, and affected tracer dynamics in sucrose and starch of shoots, but not roots: recent C was slowly incorporated into root starch irrespective of the shading treatment. Shading reduced leaf respiration more strongly than root respiration. It caused no reduction in the amount of 13C incorporated into fungi and Gram-negative bacteria, but increased its residence time.


* These findings suggest that, under interrupted C supply, belowground C allocation (as reflected by the amount of tracer allocated to root starch, soil microbial communities and belowground respiration) was maintained at the expense of aboveground C status, and that C source strength may affect the turnover of recent plant-derived C in soil microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial biosphere models  typically abstract the immense diversity of vegetation forms and functioning into a relatively small set of predefined semi-empirical plant functional types ({PFTs}). There is growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as from modelling studies that current {PFT} schemes may not adequately represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model ({JeDi}-{DGVM}) as a new approach to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a small number of fixed {PFTs}.
 {JeDi}-{DGVM} simulates the performance of a large number of randomly generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme.
 We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well simulated by {JeDi}-{DGVM}, and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the {JeDi}-{DGVM} modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies. Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e. it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard {PFT}-based approaches and with fewer inputs.
 The approach implemented here in {JeDi}-{DGVM} sets the foundation for future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere.},

* The model predicts that, when overall conditions are suitable for flowering, plants should never flower after ‘peak N’, the point during development when the whole-plant N uptake rate reaches its maximum. Our model further predicts correlations between flowering time and vegetative growth rates, and that the response to increased N depends heavily on how this extra N is made available. We compare our predictions to observations in the literature.


* We suggest that annual plants may have evolved to use growth-rate rules as part of the cue for flowering, allowing them to smoothly and optimally adjust their flowering time to a wide range of local conditions. If so, there are widespread implications for the study of the molecular biology behind flowering pathways.},

These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called {TROLL}. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 106 light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The {TROLL} model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.},

	abstract = {Weed dynamics models are essential for assessing crop management techniques and cropping systems. They must include a competition model that accounts for the particular characteristics of crop:weed stands, i.e. heterogeneous canopies consisting of contrasting species presenting a high morphological plasticity and resulting from successive emergence flushes. In a previous study, we developed a model which predicts light incidence and absorption in each location of a 3D, individual-based canopy as a function of plant morphology, latitude and seasonal solar height. Plant morphology was simplified to a set of five plant traits (plant height, diameter, leaf vs. non-leaf biomass ratio, specific leaf area and median leaf distribution height). Here, the objective was to propose and parameterize a new modelling approach for predicting these simplified morphological variables as a function of two effects that are notoriously difficult to separate (1) plant biomass which results from past light absorption and determines a large part of the current competitive ability and (2) past and current shading to integrate changes in morphology resulting from plant response to shading. A field experiment was sown with oilseed rape in September. Gaps were artificially created in the canopy by removing seedlings after emergence; additional bare-soil plots were created. Target plants of one grass weed species (Alopecurus myosuroides), three broadleaved weed species (Galium aparine, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria media), and one broadleaved crop species (oilseed rape) were transplanted into the various canopy scenarios. Target and canopy plants were sampled five times from October to April to determine the morphological variables. A shading index was calculated from incident light averaged over each target plant from predictions with the light availability submodel. A single equation was successfully fitted to each morphological variable, estimating parameters in shadeless conditions, a correlation parameter with plant biomass (for height and diameter only), and a parameter representing sensitivity to shading for each variable, species and date. Plant biomass decreased in the shade but plants were taller with more stem biomass (except in grass weeds) and larger/thinner leaves concentrated towards the top of the plant. The grass species was least plastic; among the broadleaved species, the crop species presented the least plasticity. The light availability and the plasticity submodels were combined to simulate the effect of crop sowing densities and patterns (row-sown vs. broadcast, varying interrow widths) on weed morphological variables. The latter was more altered in dense and in row-sown vs. broadcast canopies but its range of variation was smaller in the former, pointing to a more selective and less diverse environment. The consequences for weed adaptation to crops and for optimizing crop and cultivar choices were discussed.},

Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring.

	abstract = {Plants react to their environment and to management interventions by adjusting physiological functions and structure. Functional–structural plant models ({FSPM}), combine the representation of three-dimensional (3D) plant structure with selected physiological functions. An {FSPM} consists of an architectural part (plant structure) and a process part (plant functioning). The first deals with (i) the types of organs that are initiated and the way these are connected (topology), (ii) co-ordination in organ expansion dynamics, and (iii) geometrical variables (e.g. leaf angles, leaf curvature). The process part may include any physiological or physical process that affects plant growth and development (e.g. photosynthesis, carbon allocation). This paper addresses the following questions: (i) how are {FSPM} constructed, and (ii) for what purposes are they useful? Static, architectural models are distinguished from dynamic models. Static models are useful in order to study the significance of plant structure, such as light distribution in the canopy, gas exchange, remote sensing, pesticide spraying studies, and interactions between plants and biotic agents. Dynamic models serve quantitatively to integrate knowledge on plant functions and morphology as modulated by environment. Applications are in the domain of plant sciences, for example the study of plant plasticity as related to changes in the red:far red ratio of light in the canopy. With increasing availability of genetic information, {FSPM} will play a role in the assessment of the significance towards plant performance of variation in genetic traits across environments. In many crops, growers actively manipulate plant structure. {FSPM} is a promising tool to explore divergent management strategies.},

This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, {ODD}, for describing {IBMs} and {ABMs}, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider {ODD} as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of {IBMs} and {ABMs}. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

Semi-natural grasslands belong to the most species-rich biotope types in Central Europe. Bridging the gap between science and application is therefore needed to deliver scientific knowledge of ecosystem-functioning and underlying key-processes to authorities allowing successful landscape management. However, current model approaches are mostly restricted to low resolution in means of space, species and complexity. The aim of this study was to develop a process-based succession model for temperate grasslands linked to a geographic information system integrating spatial explicit input data from the real landscape and visualizing output in raster maps, which is a prerequisite for application. To cope with the trade-off between the fine resolution and the data-hunger of a mechanistic landscape model, within the presented model approach the complexity was reduced to three parameters that determine species’ growth and thus competitive power: maximal growth rate, a factor for self-regulation, and Briemle's utilization numbers. Following the principles of phytosociology, we calibrated species’ growth based on the community data set for a specific location. Model calibration and model testing showed that Briemle's utilization numbers and the chosen representative species and groups are suitable to simulate grassland dynamics under different forms of land use. As we are using a general pattern of differential equations, we are confident that the model can be easily transferred to other grassland sites. Our model concept was created in close cooperation with stakeholders and has been already successfully used as a decision support system by the Eifel National Park administration.},

We identify the role of fine-scale light heterogeneity in controlling broad-scale community behavior in {SORTIE}, an empirically derived, stochastic forest simulation model. {SORTIE} employs a very detailed measure of local light based on a 216-point sample around every tree. We test the importance of this fine-scale description of local light by reformulating {SORTIE} with less detail in this algorithm. Predicted forests are compared at several scales from total tree biomass (coarse grained) and patterns of forest succession to the local spatial pattern of light availability at the forest floor (fine grained). {SORTIE} is surprisingly insensitive to the amount of detail used in the calculation of the local resource, light. In all simulations, 48- and 16-point samples accurately reproduce the local light environment and thus predict forest development without appreciable error. A one-point sample of light significantly alters the estimates of the local light environment, but the emergent forest dynamics are insensitive to these alterations. The robustness of the forest model to the altered light environment stems from two very different mechanisms. First, the alterations of the light environment have very short correlation lengths in time and space. This allows fine-scale averaging to occur on the landscape. Second, the functional relationships among light availability, growth rate, and mortality risk in several key species tend to prevent the altered light environment from affecting individual tree performance. These results demonstrate that emergent forest dynamics in {SORTIE} do not require detailed local light estimation to capture the interaction between local resource heterogeneity and the functional responses of trees. In addition, we have shown that comparing model predictions at several scales provides a strong methodology to identify relevant detail and understand scaling in this model of a forest.},

Most existing light availability models either consider only homogeneous canopies or are based on optical principles that are too complex for multi-annual and large-scale simulations required for evaluating weed dynamics. The {TROLL} model adopted a simpler approach, discretizing the canopy into cubic volume cells (“voxels”) and successively calculating {PAR} transmitted between voxel layers as a function of leaf area and extinction coefficient in each voxel. The present study aimed at developing at a simple, generic individual-based 3D model predicting light availability and interception in heterogeneous canopies for subsequent introduction into a weed dynamics model called {FlorSys}. In a first step, {TROLL} was adapted to crop:weed canopies for arable crops in temperate latitudes by (1) developing a new function adapted to annuals for describing plant morphology, (2) accounting for lateral light transmission as a function of solar angle, and (3) predicting the variation in lateral transmission with season and latitude. In the second step, the predictions produced by the {FlorSys} light availability model were compared to {PAR} measurements in heterogeneous crop stands. The model was shown to rank situations correctly and to predict incident {PAR} satisfactorily. A sensitivity analysis of {FlorSys} identified the voxel size optimizing prediction quality. In the last step, simulations were run to evaluate the potential of biological weed regulation via crop:weed competition for light. The present model will be connected to emergence, growth and development models in further studies.},

	abstract = {lmost all models of plant resource limitation are grounded in either one or
both of two simple conceptual models: Liebig’s Minimum Hypothesis ({LMH}), the idea that
plants are limited by the resource in shortest supply, and the Multiple Limitation Hypothesis
({MLH}), the idea that plants should adjust to their environment so that all essential resources
are equally limiting. Despite the differences in their predictions, experiments have so far failed
to discriminate between them. In a simple factorial nitrogen and water addition experiment in
a Minnesota grassland, we observed shifts in allocation that, as in previous studies, are not all
explained by a single theory. We found that leaf biomass responded positively to nitrogen
additions but did not respond to water additions. We found that fine-root biomass increased
in response to water additions, but only at low nitrogen levels, and that fine-root biomass
decreased in response to nitrogen additions, but only at high water levels.
To understand these responses we built a physiologically based model of plant competition
for water, nitrogen, and space to predict plant allocation to fine roots and leaves. Critically, we
include in our model the inherent variability of soil moisture and treat light, water, and
nitrogen as resources with distinct mechanistic roles. Experimental results showed that plants
were nitrogen and water limited. The model explains the experimental results, under
conditions of co-limitation, as follows. Foliage increases with nitrogen additions but not water
additions because leaf construction is constrained by nitrogen uptake. When water is added,
plants spend a larger fraction of the growing season limited by light (and effectively nitrogen)
than by water. Thus, water additions cause fine-root biomass to increase because of the
increased importance of nitrogen limitation. The response of fine-root biomass to water
additions decreases with nitrogen additions because these additions reduce nitrogen limitation.
In general, our results are explained by sequential resource limitation. The rate of carbon
assimilation may be limited by a single resource at any one moment, but the identity of the
limiting resource(s) changes throughout the growing season.},

	abstract = {Resource partitioning, facilitation, and sampling effect are the three mechanisms behind the biodiversity effect, which is depicted usually as the effect of plant-species richness on aboveground net primary production. These mechanisms operate simultaneously but their relative importance and interactions are difficult to unravel experimentally. Thus, niche differentiation and facilitation have been lumped together and separated from the sampling effect. Here, we propose three hypotheses about interactions among the three mechanisms and test them using a simulation model. The model simulated water movement through soil and vegetation, and net primary production mimicking the Patagonian steppe. Using the model, we created grass and shrub monocultures and mixtures, controlled root overlap and grass water-use efficiency ({WUE}) to simulate gradients of biodiversity, resource partitioning and facilitation. The presence of shrubs facilitated grass growth by increasing its {WUE} and in turn increased the sampling effect, whereas root overlap (resource partitioning) had, on average, no effect on sampling effect. Interestingly, resource partitioning and facilitation interacted so the effect of facilitation on sampling effect decreased as resource partitioning increased. Sampling effect was enhanced by the difference between the two functional groups in their efficiency in using resources. Morphological and physiological differences make one group outperform the other; once these differences were established further differences did not enhance the sampling effect. In addition, grass {WUE} and root overlap positively influence the biodiversity effect but showed no interactions.},

	abstract = {An individual-based model describing the dynamics of one type of annual plants is presented. We use Monte Carlo simulations where each plant has its own history and the interactions among plants are between nearest neighbours. The character of the interaction (positive or negative) depends on local conditions. The plants compete for two external resources—water and light. The amount of water and/or light a plant receives depends on the external factor but also on local arrangement. Survival, growth and seed production of plants are determined by how well their demands for the resources are met. The survival and seeds production tests have a probabilistic character, which makes the dynamics more realistic than by using a deterministic approach. There is a non-linear coupling between the external supplies. Water evaporates from the soil at a rate depending on constant evaporation rate, local conditions and the amount of light. We examine the dynamics of the plant population along two environmental gradients, allowing also for surplus of water and/or light. We show that the largest number of plants is when the demands for both resources are equal to the supplies. We estimate also the role of evaporation and we find that it depends on the situation. It could be negative, but sometimes it has a positive character. We show that the link between the type of interaction (positive or negative) and external conditions has a complex character. In general in favourable environment plants have a stronger tendency for competitive interactions, leading to mostly isolated plants. When the conditions are getting more difficult, cooperation becomes the dominant type of interactions and the plants grow in clusters. The type of plants—sun-loving or shade tolerating, plays also an important role.},

The role of different factors (from niche separation to demographic structure) has been explored. Nevertheless, spatial mechanisms of water–vegetation interactions have been rarely taken into account, despite their well-known importance for vegetation distribution. Here, we introduce a spatial model including tree and grass biomass dynamics, together with soil and surface water dynamics. We consider two water–vegetation feedbacks. Grasses increase water infiltration into the soil, while tree shadow limits evaporation, and both mechanisms increase soil water availability, leading to positive feedbacks. The infiltration feedback can also lead to spatial pattern formation. Despite the fact that trees and grasses compete for the same resource, namely water, we observe stable coexistence as a possible model outcome. The system displays a complex behavior, with multiple stable states and possible catastrophic shifts between states, e.g., patterned grassland, bare soil and forest. In our model, coexistence is always linked with multi-stability and spatial pattern formation, driven by grass infiltration feedback. Given such complex model solutions, we expect that, under real conditions, heterogeneities and disturbances, acting on the multi-stable states, may further foster coexistence.},

The main objective of this study was to test whether the introduction of large herbivores retard the succession by reducing the abundance of highly competitive tall species and whether it is accompanied with changes in plant community composition and spatial distribution of plant species. Methods – In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of grazing by large herbivores on vegetation at three hierarchical levels: individual plant species, emergent groups of functionally similar herbaceous plant species, and the main gradients of plant community composition. Study sites were thirteen spatially separated, dry coastal dune grasslands in western Belgium and north-western France. Key results – Grazing had a predominantly negative effect on high competitive dominant species and led to changes in composition of emergent groups toward less competitive plant species. Additionally, these changes in plant community composition were accompanied with changes in spatial distribution patterns of individual plant species and community richness. Conclusions – Our results suggest that the current grazing management applied in these nature reserves is able to prevent the expansion of dominant highly competitive species and establishment of functionally different plant species.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing body of evidence showing that plant competition and facilitation usually operate simultaneously to drive population dynamics, community structure and ecosystem functions. However, the potential role of facilitation in spatial patterning of plant populations has rarely been explicitly examined. We used a ‘zone-of-influence’ model to explore how facilitation interacts with competition and abiotic stress to determine the spatial patterning of populations during density-dependent mortality. Model simulations revealed that started with the same clustered pattern, the final pattern of simulated populations depended strongly on the interaction among facilitation, stress level and size-symmetry of competition. Asymmetric competition consistently led to immediate and non-random mortality towards regularity, thus rapidly decayed the initially clustered pattern to final patterns of small-scale regularity and large-scale randomness. The role of symmetric competition in decaying the clustered pattern increased with abiotic stress because stress-induced reductions in plants’ growth rates can make individuals in high-density clusters more likely to die even from symmetric competition. Facilitation played a clear role in counteracting the effect of stress, thus tended to maintain the degree of clustering of the pattern during density-dependent mortality. This is because the amelioration of harsh conditions by neighboring plants relieved the reductions in plant growth due to competition, thus slowed down and reduced the mortality inside clusters (relative to that outside clusters). Moreover, the effect of facilitation appeared to increase with abiotic stress. Our results indicate that facilitation among neighboring plants should partially be responsible for clustered population spatial patterns observed in stressful environments, even though its contribution relative to other factors (e.g. local dispersal and environmental heterogeneity) remains to be evaluated. In addition, the potential influence of facilitation on self-thinning trajectory should be explicitly examined in future modeling and experimental studies considering its effects on density-dependent mortality.},

	abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the “fit” of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near‐optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e.g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i.e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck’s concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species’ distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a “mismatch” between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of “environmental islands” (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of “trailing‐edge” populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

	abstract = {* We review plant competition in water-limited environments with focus on temporal niche dynamics and examine implications for diversity–productivity relationships and the response of ecosystem productivity to changes in water availability. The main theses under examination are that (i) plant functional types ({PFTs}) have distinct resource pulse use and coexist through mechanism of temporal resource use complementarity; and (ii) species of same {PFT} (functionally redundant species) coexist through distinct recruitment niches.


* In water-limited systems, opportunities for plant resource uptake and growth fluctuate through time, dependent on precipitation patterns. Species differ in the sensitivities of germination, seedling mortality and adult productivity to pulses of water availability, and this generates opportunity for temporal niche diversification. We illustrate this in two case studies.


* Case study I. Savannas: This is an example of niche separation between two distinct plant functional types ({PFTs}), trees and grasses. Several models suggest that the two {PFTs} have complementary resource pulse use, which regulates their abundances, but other models suggest that tree abundance is regulated by the narrow recruitment niche of trees. Overly restrictive recruitment niches can cause a mismatch between resource availability, {PFT} composition and ecosystem productivity.


* Case study {II}. The tropical dry forest: Here, we examine niche separation between closely related species of same {PFT}. These species commonly have distinct temporal recruitment niches based on differences in seed and seedling traits. A diversification of recruitment niches may be necessary for sympatric speciation and has the effect of broadening of the recruitment ‘portfolio’ of a phylogenetic lineage and {PFT}.


* Synthesis: Functional diversity, characterized by differences in adult resource use, optimizes ecosystem function in a pulsed resource environment only if {PFT} abundances are regulated by adult resource use. Regulation through recruitment niches tends to uncouple plant productivity from resource availability. However, we hypothesize that a diversification of recruitment niches within {PFTs} may help alleviate recruitment limitations and help communities attain a {PFT} composition that optimizes resource use and permits adaptation to climate change.},

This model requires daily potential evapotranspiration and rainfall as input climatic data. Required site and stand parameters are only maximum extractable soil water and leaf area index, the latter controlling (i) stand transpiration; (ii) forest floor evapotranspiration; and (iii) rainfall interception. Other informations, like root distribution and soil porosity, can be used if available, improving the simulation of short term soil water recharge. Water stress is assumed to occur when relative extractable soil water ({REW}) drops below a threshold of 0.4 under which transpiration is gradually reduced due to stomatal closure. The model was calibrated using sap flow measurements of stand transpiration in oak and spruce stands during several successive dehydration–rehydration cycles. Validation of the model was performed by comparing predicted soil water content to weekly neutron probe measurements in various forest stands and climatic conditions. The model simulated accurately the dynamics of soil water depletion and recharge, and predicted the main components of forest water balance. Day-to-day estimates of soil water content during the growing season allows to quantify duration and intensity of drought events, and to compute stress indexes. A dendroecological application is presented: a retrospective analysis of the effects of drought on radial tree growth, based on long term climatic time series, is shown. Some limitations and potential applications of the model are discussed.},

	abstract = {Whereas it is recognized that management of plant diversity can be the key to reconciling production and environmental aims, most grassland models are tailored for high-value grass species. We proposed to adapt a mono-specific grass model to take into account specific features of species-rich permanent grasslands, especially over the reproductive phase. To this end, we used the concept of plant functional type ({PFT}), i.e. the grouping of plant species according to plant traits determined by the response of plant species to different management practices (land use and fertilization) and characterizing of agronomic properties of the corresponding species. In the model, weather and nutrient availability act upon rates of biophysical processes (radiation capture and use, plant senescence). These rates are modified over times due to {PFT}-specific parameters determined experimentally which represent the different strategies of plant species regarding growth. The integration of these parameters into the model made it possible to predict herbage biomass accumulation rate under different management practices for a wide range of plant communities differing in their {PFT} composition. The model was evaluated in two steps, first by analyzing separately the effects of {PFT} and an indicator of nutrient availability on herbage accumulation and then by conducting a sensitivity analysis. It was validated using two independent datasets; a cutting experiment running over the whole growing season to examine the consistency of the model outputs under different cutting regimes, and a monitoring of meadows and pastures in spring over a whole growth cycle to assess the model’s ability to reproduce growth curves. Although a good fit was observed between the simulated and observed data, the few discrepancies noticed between field data and predicted values were attributed mainly to the potential presence of non-grass species. More specifically, we noticed that nutrient (mainly nitrogen) availability is the main driver of plant growth rate, and that {PFT} determines the times at which this rate changes in relation to the phenological characteristics of species present. We concluded that integration of the {PFT} concept into the initial mono-specific growth model is especially suited to evaluating the consequences of management practices on species-rich permanent grasslands to meet feed production targets.},

Simulated key processes are light utilization, leaf formation, leaf elongation, tillering, and carbon partitioning (storage, shoot, root). Source- and sink-limited growth are simulated independently. Sink-limited growth is characterized by temperature-dependent leaf expansion and tiller development, whereas source-limited growth is determined by photosynthetic light-use-efficiency of the canopy and the remobilization of stored carbohydrates in the stubble. At each integration step, commonly 1 day, the available amount of carbon from the source is compared with the carbon required by the sink. The actual growth is determined by the minimum value of either the sink or the source. If the source is in excess of the sink, the surplus is allocated to storage carbohydrates in the stubble. This storage carbon is available for remobilization at times that the sink requires more carbohydrates than are available from photosynthesis. In contrast to previous grassland models, {LINGRA} describes regrowth after defoliation in a mechanistic way, balanced by temperature-driven remobilization of stored carbohydrates. In order to validate {LINGRA}, an extensive set of experimental data was used, derived from measurements at 35 sites in Europe. The average error between the observed and predicted yields was 14\% at the level of irrigated, and 19\% at the level of non-irrigated, treatments for the whole of Europe.},

The model is inspired in data for plants of three species (Elyonurus adustus, Leptocoryphium lanatum and Andropogon semiberbis) of common grasses in the Venezuelan savannas that were sampled monthly for 1 year. These species represent different architecture and regeneration response to fire. Modules (shoots and leaves) were counted in each cell of a square grid in each one of several vertical levels. Module density per cell provides the horizontal distribution within a level and is aggregated by level to obtain vertical distribution. Both distributions are simulated by a dynamical model based on shoot emergence and mortality, elongation of shoots and leaves given by Richards’ equation, plus a few simple geometric considerations. For quantitative comparisons of model results to data, the transient and final values for vertical distribution plus two metrics of horizontal distribution at each level, were calculated for the simulation results and the field data. Proportion of occupied cells and maximum distance to the center of growth were the two metrics selected to capture the dispersion and range of the horizontal distribution. The model results indicate predictable final vertical profiles (of proportional density plus the two metrics) similar to the profiles of measured distributions for each species. A reasonable prediction of the transient behavior was also obtained but with larger deviations as evaluated by the root mean square error between model and data. Differences in vertical and horizontal patterns of module density among species are explained by changing a set of parameter values related to growth form and phenology. Thus, the model could be applied to generate plant functional types for analysis of savanna dynamics subject to fire. With modifications, the model is potentially applicable to other grass plants and other grassland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {A simulation model for the prediction of grassland (Lolium perenne) productivity under conditions of climate change is described and validated for grass growing in the Wageningen Rhizolab, Wageningen, The Netherlands. In this work the model was used to study the impact of different management strategies on the productivity of grassland under present and increased atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations. In {LINGRA}-{CC} simulated key processes are light utilization, leaf formation, leaf elongation, tillering and carbon partitioning. The daily growth rate is determined by the minimum of a sink and a source term. As in a previous model ({LINGRA}), the potential growth of the sink depends on the mean daily temperature, and can be modified by the effects of the availability of assimilates on tillering. The growth of roots is calculated from the amount of carbohydrates the shoot is unable to utilize when the number or activity of the sinks is small (overflow hypothesis). The main difference between {LINGRA} and {LINGRA}-{CC} is the way the source of assimilates for growth is calculated. Assimilate production depends on intercepted radiation, and a photosynthetic light-use efficiency ({LUE}) calculated as a function of {CO}2, temperature, light intensity and the Rubisco concentration of upper leaves. Other differences are that in {LINGRA}-{CC}, the specific shoot area for new growth depends on the level of reserves. Data from two independent experiments with L. perenne swards, grown in enclosures at two levels of {CO}2 during 1994 and 1995, were used to calibrate and validate the model, respectively. The model predicted well the observed amounts of harvested biomass, and the dynamics of the leaf area index, tiller number and specific shoot area. {LINGRA}-{CC} was used to study the effects of different combinations of cutting interval and cutting height on biomass production, at ambient (350 μmol mol−1 {CO}2) and double (700 μmol mol−1 {CO}2 ) {CO}2 conditions. Under both ambient and doubled {CO}2, maximum biomass was produced with cuttings of leaf area index {\textgreater}1, and at cutting intervals of 20 and 17 d for ambient and increased {CO}2 environments, respectively. Under high {CO}2 conditions the cutting interval for maximum yield was 15\% shorter than at ambient {CO}2. However, the gain in harvested biomass obtained by reducing the cutting interval by 3 d under high {CO}2 conditions was negligible.},

Predictions are presented for the dynamics of acclimation, acclimated and non-acclimated photosynthetic rates are compared, and the dependence of leaf properties on light and N availability is explored. There is good correspondence of predictions with experimental results at the leaf level. The model also provides a mechanism for a down regulation of photosynthesis in response to increased carbon dioxide concentrations, whose magnitude will depend on conditions, particularly of nitrogen nutrition.},

	abstract = {A simple recipe for modelling the dynamics of the legume component of a grass-legume pasture simulator is proposed, avoiding some of the difficulties associated with representing the pasture submodel as autonomous but interacting grass and legume components. A target legume content of the sward is assumed to depend on the carbon:nitrogen ratio in the plant substrate carbon and nitrogen pools (these represent the labile and easily mobilizable C and N pools in the plant). The rate at which the actual legume content approaches the target content is proportional to the gross specific growth rate of the pasture. The canopy extinction coefficient and the dinitrogen fixation rate for the pasture are adjusted according to the changing legume content. The method has been incorporated into a generic single-species grassland simulator, the Hurley Pasture Model. Seasonal changes in legume fraction and associated variables are simulated. Next, the response of the legume fraction to step changes in nitrogen fertilizer application, carbon dioxide concentration, rainfall and temperature are predicted for a grazed pasture. Yield from frequent harvesting is also examined for four treatments: ambient and elevated carbon dioxide × low and high nitrogen fertilizer application. Qualitatively, the simulations agree well with experimental findings. This indicates that some important aspects of grass-legume competition could operate primarily through the pasture carbon:nitrogen substrate ratio. This ratio may determine those characteristics of morphology, growth and function that largely define the differential success of the two components of grass-legume swards; however, causation would not be proved (as far as this is scientifically possible) without a detailed mechanistic model. The approach may be useful for the investigation of management and climate-change problems in grassland.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems provide important functioning and servic

production or storage of atmospheric carbon. Two ex
amples of such ecosystems are temperate
grasslands and tropical forests. Both vegetation ar
e rich of various species, whereby each of
the respective ecosystem benefits from its species-
richness concerning their functioning, i.e.
productivity. In this thesis both vegetation are in
the focus of the investigations. In the first
chapter, a review of existing grassland and vegetat
ion models provides an overview of
important aspects, which have to be considered for
modelling temperate grasslands in the
context of biomass production. Based on the review,
new conceptual modelling approaches
for temperate grasslands are proposed. In the third
chapter, derived from the suggested
concept, the process-oriented and individual-based
grassland model Grassmind is presented.
In the fourth chapter, the model Grassmind is used
in order to parameterize and simulate the
annual dynamics of a typical Central European grass
species. Grassmind is able to reproduce
the structure and dynamics of a temperate grass spe
cies. With reference to the parameterized
grass species, a simulation study using defined spe
cies groups is performed in order to
investigate on the effect of the richness of specie
s groups on aboveground productivity. We do
not observe a significant positive effect of specie
s group richness on productivity, which is
explained by limitations of using the parameterized
grass species as a reference. In the fifth
chapter, comprehensive investigations are carried o
ut on the example of stem size
distributions in forests concerning their statistic
al analyses, i.e. by using maximum likelihood
estimation. The effects of uncertainties, i.e. binn
ing of measured stem sizes or random
measurement errors, are examined in detail. Uncerta
inties bias the analyses of maximum
likelihood estimations. It is shown, that the use o

include either binning or measurement errors, reduc
e these biases to a large extent. For both
studies, i.e. modelling of temperate grasslands and
analysing stem size distributions of forests,
the presented investigations are discussed and poss

	abstract = {We investigated the connection between plant species diversity and climate by using a process-based, generic plant model. Different ‘species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a ‘Monte Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant ‘species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of ‘hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful ‘species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant ‘prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful ‘species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of ‘rainy days' and ‘warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the ‘species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.},

The objective of this paper is to use a process-based vegetation model to evaluate the relationship between modelled and observed global patterns of plant diversity and the geographic distribution of biomes. Location  The global terrestrial biosphere. Methods  We implemented and tested a novel vegetation model aimed at identifying strategies that enable plants to grow and reproduce within particular climatic conditions across the globe. Our model simulates plant survival according to the fundamental ecophysiological processes of water uptake, photosynthesis, reproduction and phenology. We evaluated the survival of an ensemble of 10,000 plant growth strategies across the range of global climatic conditions. For the simulated regional plant assemblages we quantified functional richness, functional diversity and functional identity. Results  A strong relationship was found (correlation coefficient of 0.75) between the modelled and the observed plant diversity. Our approach demonstrates that plant functional dissimilarity increases and then saturates with increasing plant diversity. Six of the major Earth biomes were reproduced by clustering grid cells according to their functional identity (mean functional traits of a regional plant assemblage). These biome clusters were in fair agreement with two other global vegetation schemes: a satellite image classification and a biogeography model (kappa statistics around 0.4). Main conclusions  Our model reproduces the observed global patterns of plant diversity and vegetation physiognomy from the number and identity of simulated plant growth strategies. These plant growth strategies emerge from the first principles of climatic constraints and plant functional trade-offs. Our study makes important contributions to furthering the understanding of how climate affects patterns of plant diversity and vegetation physiognomy from a process-based rather than a phenomenological perspective.},

These two prevailing models, as they stand, are conceptually divergent. The {MSL} model implicitly assumes that, at a given site, for each grazing intensity there is a single equilibrium situation with a single diversity value. The S–T model suggests that rangeland dynamics include irreversible transitions and alternative equilibria. Here we propose a modification of the original {MSL} model, to encompass a wider range of real situations and to place it within the context of the S–T model. The four extreme cases proposed in the original {MSL} model are revisited, taking into account that (1) the “moisture” gradient can be generalized as a “productivity” gradient; (2) the selective pressure of herbivores on systems with long history of grazing has fluctuated over time, allowing the development of different pools of species adapted to low or high grazing intensities; and (3) systems with long evolutionary history of grazing have developed resilience mechanisms that allow reversible shifts in floristic composition with changes in grazing intensities. The grazing intensity vs. diversity curves thus postulated for systems with a long evolutionary history of grazing are similar to those proposed by the original {MSL} model because resilience mechanisms allow for reversible changes associated with grazing intensity. In contrast, the curves postulated for systems with short evolutionary history of grazing include different alternative branches, indicating irreversible transitions, because resilience mechanisms to grazing were not fully developed. By incorporating these modifications, the divergence between the original {MSL} and S–T models can be resolved. A set of published examples from real systems is presented and compared with the predictions of the modified model. The modified {MSL} model is applicable to a wider range of real situations than the {MSL} model in its original formulation.},

The importance of these three factors was first reviewed and then examined with a spatially explicit, multi-species model of plant dispersal, competition and establishment, with an assumption of neutrality (all species had equivalent life histories) that reduced the initial dimensionality of the problem. The simulations assumed that the probability of immigration was a linear function of mainland abundance and distance to islands, similar to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity. The rate of increase in species richness was not constant across island sizes, declining as island area became very large. This pattern was explained by the spatial dynamics of colonization and establishment, a non-random process that cannot be explained by passive sampling alone. Simulations showed that population establishment depended critically on rare long-distance dispersal events while population persistence was achieved by the formation of aggregated species distributions that developed through restricted dispersal and local competitive interactions. Nevertheless, species richness always declined to a single species in the absence of disturbances, while up to 40 species could persist to 10,000 years when spatially dependent mortality was added. Further explorations with spatially explicit models will be required to fully appreciate the consequence of land use change and altered disturbance regimes on patterns of species distribution and the maintenance of diversity.},

	abstract = {Differential growth response to light level is widely accepted as a potential mechanism for maintaining tree species richness in tropical forests. The position of tree species in the hierarchy of the canopy is considered an important indicator of species light capture and growth strategy. Paradoxically, the relative importance of species identity and competition for light in determining individual tree growth is poorly documented at the adult stage. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the overall importance of species identity, light and belowground competition as determinants of tree growth in French Guiana tropical forest. Light competitive status is assessed by a crown exposure score and below ground competition is estimated from local crowding. We examined species sensitivity to both types of competition in relation to adult stature.

Our results are based on annual diameter increments of more than 13,510 stems from 282 species monitored over 10 years. Mean annual growth rate was 0.11 cm y−1 with species identity explaining 35\% of the individual variation in growth rate. Crown exposure and local crowding explained 3.5\% and 2.4\% of the variation in growth rate, respectively. Predicted changes in growth rate as crown exposure (resp. local crowding) index changed from lower to upper interquartile level was 0.03 cm y−1 (resp. 0.02 cm y−1). Species sensitivity to crown exposure and to local crowding were positively correlated (i) with predicted growth rate at high-light standardized conditions and (ii) with adult stature.

This vertical niche partitioning is invoked to explain the limited contribution made by level of light competition for predicting individual tropical tree growth as the community-level response is dominated by the abundance of small-statured species with low sensitivity to light level.

Light appears to drive the stem growth rate of tropical trees through species differentiation more than through individual tree growth limitation. This vertical stratification complements the previously reported regeneration niche and together these provide evidence for light niche partitioning in the three-dimensional space of tropical forests.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

It is surprising then that this area of research has not grown in prominence with respect to other approaches employed in modelling plant systems. In this review, we provide an analysis of the development and role of modelling in the field of plant population biology through an exploration of where it has been, where it is now and, in our opinion, where it should be headed. We focus, in particular, on the role plant population modelling could play in ecological forecasting, an urgent need given current rates of regional and global environmental change. We suggest that a critical element limiting the current application of plant population modelling in environmental research is the trade-off between the necessary resolution and detail required to accurately characterize ecological dynamics pitted against the goal of generality, particularly at broad spatial scales. In addition to suggestions how to overcome the current shortcoming of data on the process-level we discuss two emerging strategies that may offer a way to overcome the described limitation: (1) application of a modern approach to spatial scaling from local processes to broader levels of interaction and (2) plant functional-type modelling. Finally we outline what we believe to be needed in developing these approaches towards a ‘science of forecasting’.},

	abstract = {Although anthropogenic climate change is generally acknowledged as a reality, tree level models that respond to the boundary conditions expected to change as a result of global warming are largely non-existent. Consequently, a process-based model of individual tree growth driven by meteorology was developed. The model, Forest v5.1 predicts the growth of deciduous and coniferous species for the Great Lakes Region of North America. The model uses a daily time step and was written with two overriding design tenets in mind: (i) model drivers must mimic controls on plant growth as they exist in nature and (ii) model initialization must be achievable through the use of typical forest inventory field plot data. Forest v5.1 predicts the carbon, nutrient and water cycle as these influence tree growth and with particular emphasis on light interception and assimilation. Model outputs are both in dimension as well as biomass. Sensitivity analysis shows the importance of parameters that characterize maximum photosynthetic potential and scaling factors. A comparison of observed and predicted growth trajectories for 25 years indicates tree diameter development exhibits useful levels of precision (−0.12 to 0.11 cm year−1) relative to an empirical model. The model, using {HadCM}2-generated weather, projects that water use efficiency will increase as a result of climate change. Net basal area increment increases on average by 0.17 m2 ha−1 year−1 relative to a projection of current climate.},

They use different precision levels of canopy description (from one to three dimensions) and different mathematical relationships to model the attenuation of radiation through the canopy.

	abstract = {Competition is a key process in plant populations and communities. We thus need, if we are to predict the responses of ecological systems to environmental change, a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of plant competition. Considering competition, however, only at the population level is not sufficient because plant individuals usually are different, interact locally, and can adapt their behaviour to the current state of themselves and of their biotic and abiotic environment. Therefore, simulation models that are individual-based and spatially explicit are increasingly used for studying competition in plant systems. Many different individual-based modelling approaches exist to represent competition, but it is not clear how good they are in reflecting essential aspects of plant competition. We therefore first summarize current concepts and theories addressing plant competition. Then, we review individual-based approaches for modelling competition among plants. We distinguish between approaches that are used for more than 10 years and more recent ones. We identify three major gaps that need to be addressed more in the future: the effects of plants on their local environment, adaptive behaviour, and below-ground competition. To fill these gaps, the representation of plants and their interactions have to be more mechanistic than most existing approaches. Developing such new approaches is a challenge because they are likely to be more complex and to require more detailed knowledge and data on individual-level processes underlying competition. We thus need a more integrated research strategy for the future, where empirical and theoretical ecologists as well as computer scientists work together on formulating, implementing, parameterization, testing, comparing, and selecting the new approaches.},

We use it to simulate the growth of a tropical savanna near the city of Barinas, Venezuela, to explore the responses of the peak biomass of a plant community to a range of 10-50\% reduction of rainfall. We selected three dominant grass species: Elyonurus adustus, Leptocoryphium lanatum, and Andropogon semiberbis in a 4 × 7 m study plot. We estimate parameters values from data measured in the field. The number of shoots for each plant is obtained according to soil water availability and distributed vertically by 10 cm levels using a transition matrix. Convolution allows calculation of leaf area index for each cell and vertical level, which is then used to calculate light attenuation and thus the proportion of shaded shoots in each cell and level. With this information, maximum evapotranspiration is determined to calculate soil moisture using daily rain time series. Biomass is calculated for all species based on shoot biomass measured in the field and fire is simulated by removing a fraction of the shoots segments of all species. Modeled biomass fits reasonably well to field data.

The model predicts significant differences in the response of each species to drought. A. semiberbis was the most drought resistant of the three species, whereas L. lanatum was the least, and E. adustus was intermediate, in agreement with observations in the literature. Our model suggests that drought resistance increases with the biomass/transpiration ratio for the species considered.},

Here, we investigated how vegetation structure and functioning may be influenced by predicted increases in annual temperatures and atmospheric {CO}2 concentration, and modeled the extent to which local plant–plant interactions may modify these effects.


* A canopy model was developed, which calculates photosynthesis as a function of light, nitrogen, temperature, {CO}2 and water availability, and considers different degrees of light competition between neighboring plants through canopy mixing; soybean (Glycine max) was used as a reference system.


* The model predicts increased net photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration under atmospheric {CO}2 increase. When {CO}2 elevation is combined with warming, photosynthesis is increased more, but transpiration is reduced less. Intriguingly, when competition is considered, the optimal response shifts to producing larger leaf areas, but with lower stomatal conductance and associated vegetation transpiration than when competition is not considered. Furthermore, only when competition is considered are the predicted effects of elevated {CO}2 on leaf area index ({LAI}) well within the range of observed effects obtained by Free air {CO}2 enrichment ({FACE}) experiments.

	abstract = {Various studies have suggested that semi-natural grasslands could be a more ecologically beneficial source for biofuel production than intensively managed monocultures. In particular, it has been observed that the high level of species diversity in grasslands has a positive effect on several ecosystem functions (e.g. productivity). Ecological models are useful tools for analyzing the interactions of different processes in grasslands, which are assumed to be the underlying drivers of this positive effect. In this paper we present a review of the main processes included in existing grassland models and discuss the strength and limitations of existing approaches in the context of biofuel production. Most of the existing models (a) focus solely on one or a few single species, (b) do not consider competition processes adequately, or (c) do not follow the individual's development in the grassland community. This hinders a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and conditions that govern the ecosystem functions that are relevant for biofuel production such as productivity, stability, and carbon fixation. To bridge this gap, we propose a concept for a novel individual-based grassland model for temperate regions. Our approach covers a high number of species/functional groups, above- and below-ground intra- and inter-specific competition for different resources (light, water, nitrogen, space), and disturbances (due to management or climate change). Hence, it could facilitate comprehensive mechanistic analyses of the dynamics of semi-natural grasslands and their efficiency in biofuel production.},

Many growth models have a central role for the process of photosynthesis; and often implicitly assume C-gain to be the rate-limiting step for biomass accumulation. We subsequently explore the extent to which this assumption actually holds and under what condition constraints on growth due to a limited sink strength are likely to occur. By using generalized dose–response curves for growth with respect to light and {CO}2, models can be tested against a benchmark for their overall performance. In the final part, a call for a systems approach at the supra-cellular level is made. This will enable a better understanding of feedbacks and trade-offs acting on plant growth and its component processes. Mechanistic growth models form an indispensable element of such an approach and will, in the end, provide the link with the (sub-)cellular approaches that are yet developing. Improved insight will be gained if model output for the various physiological processes and morphological variables (‘virtual profiling’) is compared with measured correlation networks among these processes and variables.

	abstract = {Background and Aims
Vegetation has long been recognized to protect the soil from erosion. Understanding species differences in root morphology and functional traits is an important step to assess which species and species mixtures may provide erosion control. Furthermore, extending classification of plant functional types towards root traits may be a useful procedure in understanding important root functions.

Methods
In this study, pioneer data on traits of alpine plant species, i.e. plant height and shoot biomass, root depth, horizontal root spreading, root length, diameter, tensile strength, plant age and root biomass, from a disturbed site in the Swiss Alps are presented. The applicability of three classifications of plant functional types ({PFTs}), i.e. life form, growth form and root type, was examined for above- and below-ground plant traits.

Key Results
Plant traits differed considerably among species even of the same life form, e.g. in the case of total root length by more than two orders of magnitude. Within the same root diameter, species differed significantly in tensile strength: some species (Geum reptans and Luzula spicata) had roots more than twice as strong as those of other species. Species of different life forms provided different root functions (e.g. root depth and horizontal root spreading) that may be important for soil physical processes. All classifications of {PFTs} were helpful to categorize plant traits; however, the {PFTs} according to root type explained total root length far better than the other {PFTs}.

Conclusions
The results of the study illustrate the remarkable differences between root traits of alpine plants, some of which cannot be assessed from simple morphological inspection, e.g. tensile strength. {PFT} classification based on root traits seems useful to categorize plant traits, even though some patterns are better explained at the individual species level.},

The correlation between density-thickness and leaf thickness was high, especially on a fresh weight basis. Leaf width appeared greater in the Arctic.

Here, we ask whether this phenomenon can be explained by constraints caused by tissue density. The hypothesis is that low tissue density is necessary for fast growth but has as a consequence short organ life span. This leads to a rapid loss of nutrients that cannot be sustained under nutrient-poor conditions. 2. Biomass accumulation, turnover rate of leaves and roots, and tissue density were studied for five ecologically contrasting grass species. Plants were grown in a garden experiment over two growing seasons on sand with a low nutrient supply level. 3. Species that were characteristic of nutrient-rich sites had a low leaf and root tissue density and were larger after one growing season than species of nutrient-poor sites. However, after two growing seasons the species of nutrient-poor sites were larger. These species had a high tissue density. 4. Life span of both leaves and roots was also correlated with tissue density. Species with low tissue density had a faster turnover of leaves and roots. 5. It is concluded that tissue structure is an inherent constraint that prevents simultaneous maximization of both nutrient acquisition and nutrient conservation. The short life span of fast-growing organs explains the long-term disadvantage of a high growth rate for plants in low nutrient conditions.},

Despite this recognized shortcoming, it is unclear which processes warrant attention in model development, given the computational cost of additional model complexity. Here, we tested the sensitivity of four models to adjustments in fine root turnover in forested systems: {CENTURY}, {ED}2, {MC}1, and {LANDCARB}. In general, faster root turnover rates resulted in lower total system carbon (C) and within model changes ranged from 1\% to 38\% following 100-year simulations. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes differed among models as some expressed lower net primary productivity ({NPP}) with faster turnover rates and others had similar {NPP} but large shifts in C allocation away from wood to fine roots. Based on these findings we expect that different model responses to changes in fine root turnover will be determined by (1) whether C is allocated to fine roots as fixed portion of {NPP} or to maintain a fixed biomass ratio between fine roots and leaves or stems and (2) whether soil nutrient and water uptake is a function of both resource availability and fine root biomass or based on resource availability alone. These results suggest that better constrained estimates of fine root turnover will represent a valuable improvement in many terrestrial biosphere models.},

Here, we collected wool materials produced from 1962 to 2010 and investigated the long-term {WUE} of an alpine meadow in Tibet on basis of the carbon isotope values of vegetation (δ13Cveg). The values of δ13Cveg decreased by 1.34‰ during 1962–2010, similar to changes in δ13C values of atmospheric {CO}2. Carbon isotope discrimination was highly variable and no trend was apparent in the past half century. Intrinsic water use efficiency (Wi) increased by 18 μmol·mol–1 (approximately 23.5\%) during 1962–2010 because the increase in the intercellular {CO}2 concentration (46 μmol·mol–1) was less than that in the atmospheric {CO}2 concentration (Ca, 73 μmol·mol–1). In addition, Wi increased significantly with increasing growing season temperature and Ca. However, effective water use efficiency (We) remained relatively stable, because of increasing vapor pressure deficit. Ca, precipitation, and growing season temperature collectively explained 45\% of the variation of We. Our findings indicate that the We of alpine meadows in the Tibetan Plateau remained relatively stable by physiological adjustment to elevated Ca and growing season temperature. These findings improve our understanding and the capacity to predict {NPP} of these ecosystems under global change scenarios.},

As leaf life spans increase, more C tends to be invested per unit {CO}₂ uptake and less N is invested per unit invested C. Thus, mass relationships rather than area relationships seem to be linked to leaf life span in these species, suggesting that leaf duration is associated with properties other than the efficiency of light utilization (e.g. mechanical strength, herbivory or pathogen resistance). It seems that the explanations of leaf duration that have been developed for evergreen/deciduous plants and for plants along steep light gradients do not apply to the variable life spans in leaves of perennial herbaceous plants of open habitats.},

Summary

There is wide breadth of root function within ecosystems that should be considered when modeling the terrestrial biosphere. Root structure and function are closely associated with control of plant water and nutrient uptake from the soil, plant carbon (C) assimilation, partitioning and release to the soils, and control of biogeochemical cycles through interactions within the rhizosphere. Root function is extremely dynamic and dependent on internal plant signals, root traits and morphology, and the physical, chemical and biotic soil environment. While plant roots have significant structural and functional plasticity to changing environmental conditions, their dynamics are noticeably absent from the land component of process-based Earth system models used to simulate global biogeochemical cycling. Their dynamic representation in large-scale models should improve model veracity. Here, we describe current root inclusion in models across scales, ranging from mechanistic processes of single roots to parameterized root processes operating at the landscape scale. With this foundation we discuss how existing and future root functional knowledge, new data compilation efforts, and novel modeling platforms can be leveraged to enhance root functionality in large-scale terrestrial biosphere models by improving parameterization within models, and introducing new components such as dynamic root distribution and root functional traits linked to resource extraction.},

Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

However, limitations in data and confusions over terminology, together with a strong dependence on a small set of conceptual frameworks, have limited the exploration of root function in terrestrial models. We review the key root processes of interest to both field ecologists and modelers including root classification, production, turnover, biomass, resource uptake, and depth distribution to ask (1) what are contemporary approaches for modeling roots in terrestrial models? and (2) can these approaches be improved via recent advancements in field research methods? We isolate several emerging themes that are ready for collaboration among field scientists and modelers: (1) alternatives to size-class based root classifications based on function and the inclusion of fungal symbioses, (2) dynamic root allocation and phenology as a function of root environment, rather than leaf demand alone, (3) improved understanding of the treatment of root turnover in models, including the role of root tissue chemistry on root lifespan, (4) better estimates of root stocks across sites and species to parameterize or validate models, and (5) dynamic interplay among rooting depth, resource availability and resource uptake. Greater attention to model parameterization and structural representation of roots will lead to greater appreciation for belowground processes in terrestrial models and improve estimates of ecosystem resilience to global change drivers.},

	abstract = {Interspecific variation in leaf life span reflects the variation in nutrient conservation ability among different plant species and is considered to be associated with nutrient availability in the characteristic habitat. As defoliation interferes with nutrient conservation by the long-lived leaves, we hypothesized that disturbance rate is another important environmental factor working as a selective force on interspecific variation in leaf life span. In order to investigate this, we measured leaf life span of 32 grass species in mature garden-grown individuals. Variation in leaf life span was compared to measured leaf traits, to available data on species occurrence along gradients of nutrient availability and disturbance, and to published relative growth rates of the species. Leaf life span was associated positively with leaf tissue mass density and negatively with specific leaf area. Leaf life span correlated negatively with the disturbance rate in the characteristic habitat of a species, but not with nutrient availability. The latter relationship did not come about due to the long leaf life spans of species from nutrient-rich habitats with a relatively low disturbance rate, and to some extent also due to the short leaf life spans of annual species from relatively nutrient-poor sites. We conclude that although leaf longevity is an important means of reducing nutrient losses, this is a selective advantage only if the plant is not subjected to frequent defoliation. The frequently postulated association between leaf life span of a species and nutrient availability in its characteristic habitat may occur among species of habitats with positively correlated nutrient availability and disturbance rate. Leaf life span is negatively associated with seedling {RGR}, but there may be deviations in this relationship due to species with contrasting characteristics at seedling stage and at maturity.},

The model predicts the most competitive (i.e., the evolutionarily stable strategy [{ESS}]) allocations to foliage, wood, and fine roots for canopy and understory stages of trees growing in old-growth forests. The {ESS} allocations, revealed as analytical functions of commonly measured physiological parameters, depend not on simple root-shoot relations but rather on diminishing returns of carbon investment that ensure any alternate strategy will underperform an {ESS} in monoculture because of the competitive environment that the {ESS} creates. As such, {ESS} allocations do not maximize nitrogen-limited growth rates in monoculture, highlighting the underappreciated idea that the most competitive strategy is not necessarily the “best,” but rather that which creates conditions in which all others are “worse.” Data from 152 stands support the model’s surprising prediction that the dominant structural trade-off is between fine roots and wood, not foliage, suggesting the “root-shoot” trade-off is more precisely a “root-stem” trade-off for long-lived trees. Assuming other resources are abundant, the model predicts that forests are limited by both nitrogen and light, or nearly so.},

With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades.

Aggregated trait averages (i.e. averages of trait values of constituent species, weighted by species proportions) are popular indices reflecting the functional characteristics of locally dominant species. Because the variation of these indices along environmental gradients can be caused by both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, it is necessary to disentangle the role of both components to community variability. For quantitative traits, trait averages can be calculated from ‘fixed’ trait values (i.e. a single mean trait value for individual species used for all habitats where the species is found) or trait values for individual species specific to each plot, or habitat, where the species is found. Changes in fixed averages across environments reflect species turnover, while changes in specific traits reflect both species turnover and within-species variability in traits. Here we suggest a practical method (accompanied by a set of R functions) that, by combining ‘fixed’ and ‘specific averages’, disentangles the effect of species turnover, intraspecific trait variability, and their covariation. These effects can be further decomposed into parts ascribed to individual explanatory variables (i.e. treatments or environmental gradients considered). The method is illustrated with a case study from a factorial mowing and fertilization experiment in a meadow in South Bohemia. Results show that the variability decomposition differs markedly among traits studied (height, Specific Leaf Area, Leaf N, P, C concentrations, leaf and stem dry matter content), both according to the relative importance of species turnover and intraspecific variability, and also according to their response to experimental factors. Both the effect of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover must be taken into account when assessing the functional role of community trait structure. Neglecting intraspecific trait variability across habitats often results in underestimating the response of communities to environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Because Farquhar’s photosynthesis model is only directly applicable to individual leaves instantaneously, considerable skill is needed to use this model for regional plant growth and carbon budget estimations. In many published models, Farquhar’s equations were applied directly to plant canopies by assuming a plant canopy to function like a big-leaf. This big-leaf approximation is found to be acceptable for estimating seasonal trends of canopy photosynthesis but inadequate for simulating its day-to-day variations, when compared with eddy-covariance and gas-exchange chamber measurements from two boreal forests. The daily variation is greatly dampened in big-leaf simulations because the original leaf-level model is partially modified through replacing stomatal conductance with canopy conductance. Alternative approaches such as separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups or stratifying the canopy into multiple layers can avoid the problem. Because of non-linear response of leaf photosynthesis to meteorological variables (radiation, temperature and humidity), considerable errors exist in photosynthesis calculation at daily steps without considering the diurnal variability of the variables. To avoid these non-linear effects, we have developed an analytical solution to a simplified daily integral of Farquhar’s model by considering the general diurnal patterns of meteorological variables. This daily model not only captures the main effects of diurnal variations on photosynthesis but is also computationally efficient for large area applications. Its application is then not restricted by availability of sub-daily meteorological data. This scheme has been tested using measured {CO}2 data from the Boreal Ecosystem–Atmosphere Study ({BOREAS}), which took place in Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 1994 and 1996.},

The contents of carbohydrates and proline, and freezing tolerance estimated by {LT}50, which is the temperature at which 50\% of the electrolytes in the organ was measured in the leachate, were determined at 10-day intervals from October 1, 2001 to April 18, 2002. It was indicated that the freezing tolerance of stolons increased ({LT}50 of stolons decreased) quickly, as temperature dropped before winter, but that of leaves which senesced along with the drop in temperature did not. The freezing tolerance of stolons decreased gradually along with the rise in temperature above 5 °C in spring, when the overwintered plants started to grow. The contents of proline and soluble carbohydrates, including sucrose, fructose and glucose, increased as {LT}50 decreased when temperature dropped below 5 °C before winter, and decreased as {LT}50 increased in early spring. Correlation analysis revealed that the freezing tolerance of stolons of centipedegrass significantly and positively correlated with the contents of proline and soluble carbohydrates, and the ratio of the soluble carbohydrates to starch. Thus, the freezing tolerance of stolons, which are critical organs that determine the winter surviving ability, largely depended on the content of soluble carbohydrates and the ratio of soluble carbohydrates to starch in centipedegrass. The possible relationship between freezing tolerance and carbohydrate metabolism was also discussed.},

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of {ITV} within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, {ITV} accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of {ITV} tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of {ITV} decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of {ITV} in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include {ITV} in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00609989/document},
	abstract = {L'hétérogénéité spatiale est aujourd'hui reconnue comme un facteur primordial pour la diversité et le fonctionnement des écosystèmes prairiaux, mais reste souvent négligée dans l'analyse de l'impact de différents modes d'utilisation pastorale. Les communautés prairiales subalpines sont des milieux hautement diversifiés, au cœur d'enjeux écologiques, socio-économiques et culturels. Depuis plusieurs décennies, des changements d'usage, notamment l'extensification conduisant parfois à l'abandon du pâturage, affectent ces prairies dans de vastes régions des Alpes. Connaitre la réponse spatiale de ces communautés à ces changements d'usage peut constituer un enjeu important pour mieux prédire les conséquences en termes de valeurs écologiques et agronomiques. L'objectif général de ce travail est d'identifier l'organisation spatiale de composantes spécifiques et fonctionnelles de communautés prairiales subalpines dans des situations contrastées d'usage : pâturage traditionnel et abandon sur le moyen terme ({\textasciitilde}20 ans), de comprendre les mécanismes liés au pâturage influençant cette organisation spatiale et d'explorer les conséquences potentielles de l'organisation spatiale des composantes spécifiques et fonctionnelles sur les valeurs d'usage de ces milieux. Ce travail révèle que l'arrêt du pâturage conduit à des modifications importantes de l'organisation spatiale à la fois des espèces et de traits fonctionnels aériens. La variabilité spatiale de ces composantes est systématiquement augmentée à différentes échelles spatiales en situation d'abandon révélant un grain plus grossier d'hétérogénéité spatiale, lié à une plus faible coexistence locale des espèces et des traits et à une convergence fonctionnelle plus forte que sous l'effet diversificateur à échelle fine du pâturage traditionnel. D'autres part, même si une réponse en termes de patrons spatiaux est également observée, celle-ci n'est pas systématique, indiquant l'absence d'une action structurante forte du pâturage qui agit donc surtout sur la variabilité. Une expérimentation in situ montre en effet que la formation de patrons spatiaux marqués en réponse à une action de défoliation sélective semble limitée dans ces prairies relativement peu productives. De plus, une faible structuration spatiale du couvert en termes de valeurs d'usage fourragère a été observée, pilotée dès des échelles très fines par la variabilité spatiale à un grain fin des assemblages d'espèces et de traits dans les zones pâturées. Ces résultats suggèrent ainsi l'expression d'un pâturage peu sélectif exprimé par les troupeaux ovins dans ces milieux peu productifs, et la prépondérance du filtre abiotique dans la détermination des assemblages spatiaux des espèces et des traits. La formation de patchs très contrastés et très structurés spatialement en réponse au pâturage est plus probable dans des milieux très productifs où la compétition est plus intense et la repousse de la végétation favorisée. La prise en compte de la variabilité autour de la réponse moyenne des communautés se révèle donc un élément essentiel pour analyser l'évolution des prairies subalpines en réponse au changement d'usages pastoraux. Une des perspectives fortes suite à ce travail est l'analyse de la synergie entre la réponse de l'hétérogénéité spatiale du couvert et celle du compartiment souterrain (traits racinaires, mycorhization, diversité microbienne…).},

In this context, we review plant functional traits, particularly those that drive invader abundance (invasiveness) and impacts, as well as the integration of these traits across multiple ecological scales, and as a basis for restoration and management.{ScopeWe} review the concepts and terminology surrounding functional traits and how functional traits influence processes at the individual level. We explore how phenotypic plasticity may lead to rapid evolution of novel traits facilitating invasiveness in changing environments and then ‘scale up’ to evaluate the relative importance of demographic traits and their links to invasion rates. We then suggest a functional trait framework for assessing per capita effects and, ultimately, impacts of invasive plants on plant communities and ecosystems. Lastly, we focus on the role of functional trait-based approaches in invasive species management and restoration in the context of rapid, global environmental change.{ConclusionsTo} understand how the abundance and impacts of invasive plants will respond to rapid environmental changes it is essential to link trait-based responses of invaders to changes in community and ecosystem properties. To do so requires a comprehensive effort that considers dynamic environmental controls and a targeted approach to understand key functional traits driving both invader abundance and impacts. If we are to predict future invasions, manage those at hand and use restoration technology to mitigate invasive species impacts, future research must focus on functional traits that promote invasiveness and invader impacts under changing conditions, and integrate major factors driving invasions from individual to ecosystem levels.},

* Twelve traits were measured on fine roots (diameter ≤ 2 mm) of 74 species (31 graminoids and 43 herbaceous and dwarf shrub eudicots) collected in three biomes.


* The findings of this study support the existence of a {RES} representing an axis of trait variation in which root respiration was positively correlated to nitrogen concentration and specific root length and negatively correlated to the root dry matter content, lignin : nitrogen ratio and the remaining mass after decomposition. This pattern of traits was highly consistent within graminoids but less consistent within eudicots, as a result of an uncoupling between decomposability and morphology, and of heterogeneity of individual roots of eudicots within the fine-root pool.


* The positive relationship found between root respiration and decomposability is essential for a better understanding of vegetation–soil feedbacks and for improving terrestrial biosphere models predicting the consequences of plant community changes for carbon cycling.},

Summary

Trait-based approaches have led to significant advances in plant ecology, but are currently biased toward above-ground traits. It is becoming clear that a stronger emphasis on below-ground traits is needed to better predict future changes in plant biodiversity and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. Here I propose six ‘below-ground frontiers’ in trait-based plant ecology, with an emphasis on traits governing soil nutrient acquisition: redefining fine roots; quantifying root trait dimensionality; integrating mycorrhizas; broadening the suite of root traits; determining linkages between root traits and abiotic and biotic factors; and understanding ecosystem-level consequences of root traits. Focusing research efforts along these frontiers should help to fulfil the promise of trait-based ecology: enhanced predictive capacity across ecological scales.},

In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a ‘systems macroecology’ will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.},

Rates of leaf extension in the upland species P. alpinum are slower than in the lowland species P. bertolonii. This difference is related in the main to the significantly greater number of cell generations involved in the expansion of the leaf and not to the cell generation time, which does not differ between the species. Experiments with the growth of callus cultures suggest that interspecific differences in the potential for cell growth do not account for the observed differences in leaf extension. In both species the response of {SLA} to temperature is mainly a consequence of its influence on cell diameter. As a result it is the temperature in the region of cell expansion, within the leaf sheath, that will control {SLA}.},

A common explanation for this universal pattern is an increase in the size asymmetry of light partitioning (the degree to which large plants receive more light per unit biomass than smaller plants), which accelerates the rates of competitive exclusions. This ‘light asymmetry hypothesis’ has been confirmed by mathematical models, but has never been tested in natural communities due to the lack of appropriate methodology for measuring the size asymmetry of light partitioning in natural communities. Here, we use a novel approach for quantifying the asymmetry of light competition which is based on measurements of the vertical distribution of light below the canopy. Using our approach, we demonstrate that an increase in light asymmetry is the main mechanism behind the negative effect of nutrient enrichment on species richness. Our results provide a possible explanation for one of the main sources of contemporary species loss in terrestrial plant communities.},

	abstract = {Despite broad evidence that recent climate change considerably affects alpine-nival vegetation, there are only a few studies revealing climate-induced vegetation changes in all vegetation belts above the actual treeline. Here, we use historical and recent vegetation surveys from the Bavarian Alps (Germany) to examine biodiversity, structural and functional trait composition changes in subalpine, lower and higher alpine vegetation belts during the past 50 years. Although species richness did not change significantly in dense subalpine vegetation, immigration of species from lower elevations and increased environmental favorability for already present thermophilic species led to an increase of plant cover (+23 \%). In low alpine plots, a significant increase in species richness and plant cover (+41 and +18 \%, respectively) was detected, due to gap availability and low competitive ability of alpine species. The results of the three-table ordination technique ({RLQ}) revealed that in subalpine and low alpine plots species with traits that are advantageous under warmer conditions, such as higher specific leaf area, high stature and heavier seeds, significantly increased their frequencies and abundances. Floristic and vegetation changes of high alpine plots were contrasting to those found in the subalpine and the low alpine vegetation located both in the study region and close mountain ridges. Despite the temperature increase and sufficient availability of colonisation gaps for newcomers, species richness (−24 \%) and plant cover (−25 \%) significantly decreased, probably due to permafrost degradation (as a consequence of recent warming). Our results suggest that considering vegetation characteristics as well as environmental conditions of different vegetation belts above the treeline is critical to accurately understand the response of alpine vegetation to climate change.},

However, the importance of soil water storage capacity ({WSC}) for plant species diversity has not been studied so far. Aims: We aim to evaluate the relevance of {WSC} for species diversity of alpine plant communities in relation to temperature and length of growing season. Methods: Species diversity was determined in 150 plots from a broad range of alpine vegetation types in the calcareous western part of the central Swiss Alps. {WSC} of soil cores sampled in every plot was determined, as well as rooting zone temperature and snowmelt date. Linear mixed models were used to assess the relationship between environmental data and species diversity. Results: Species diversity was most strongly and positively related to {WSC}, followed by mean daily minimum temperature (Tmin) of the growing season. Species diversity was significantly related to date of snowmelt only in sites with high {WSC} and/or Tmin. Conclusions: {WSC} represents an integrative measure for habitat quality and accounts for differences in species diversity within the study region. In order to understand and predict responses of plant species to climate change in high mountain regions, it may be crucial to also take changes in plant water supply into account.},

Strikingly, although the effect of cushion species on diversity was lower than that of climate, its contribution was still substantial. In particular, cushion species enhanced species richness more in systems with inherently impoverished local diversity. Nurse species appear to act as a ‘safety net’ sustaining diversity under harsh conditions, demonstrating that climate and species interactions should be integrated when predicting future biodiversity effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {*
The functional structure of plant communities can be altered by grazing through two main mechanisms: species turnover (i.e. changes in species occurrence and relative abundance) and intraspecific trait variability ({ITV}), which is driven by phenotypic responses of individual plants and shifts in the relative abundance of genotypic variants within species. Studies of grassland ecosystem function under grazing often focus on community changes induced by species turnover, which ignores the effects of {ITV} on biomass productivity, soil carbon or nutrient availability. By quantifying the relative contribution of both effects on shifts in community-wide traits, we highlight the role of {ITV} in community functional response to grazing and its implications for ecosystem function in Tibetan alpine meadows.



*
We measured three chemical traits ({LC}: leaf carbon, {LN}: leaf nitrogen and {LP}: leaf phosphorus concentrations) and two morphological traits ({SLA}: specific leaf area, {LDMC}: leaf dry matter content) that are critical components of plant production and forage quality in grazed and ungrazed plots. Using variance decomposition of community-weighted means ({CWM}) for these foliar traits, we distinguished the relative importance of {ITV} vs. change in species occurrence and abundance in response to grazing and the associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient availability.



*
The {CWM} for foliar nutrients and {SLACWM} increased in response to grazing together with decreases in soil carbon and nutrient stores, especially {LPCWM} enrichment and loss of available soil P. The {LPCWM} was strongly negatively correlated with {LDMCCWM}, which was significantly higher in ungrazed plots. These community-wide trait responses to grazing were generally best captured by {ITV} and not changes in species occurrence and abundance, although {ITV} was consistently correlated with species turnover for all traits.



*
Synthesis and applications. In response to continuous grazing, plants in Tibetan alpine meadows increase specific leaf area and foliar nutrients but tend to have lower leaf dry matter content, a response consistent with faster growth and regrowth under grazing. This intraspecific trait variability response drives a shift in community function from conservative, slow-growing resource use in ungrazed meadows to exploitative resource use under grazing. This community-wide functional response enhances forage quality, in turn favouring the secondary productivity of small herbivorous mammal communities, but also contributes to accelerated depletion of soil available phosphorus. We discuss the implications of these results for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem function and rangeland sustainability in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, especially with regard to managing grazing rotation to strike a balance between favouring secondary productivity of domesticated stock vs. small herbivorous mammals.},

	abstract = {Species richness in the alpine zone varies dramatically when communities are compared. We explored (i) which stress and disturbance factors were highly correlated with species richness, (ii) whether the intermediate stress hypothesis ({ISH}) and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis ({IDH}) can be applied to alpine ecosystems, and (iii) whether standing crop can be used as an easily measurable surrogate for causal factors determining species richness in the alpine zone. Species numbers and standing crop were determined in 14 alpine plant communities in the Swiss Alps. To quantify the stress and disturbance factors in each community, air temperature, relative air humidity, wind speed, global radiation, {UV}-B radiation, length of the growing season, soil suction, {pH}, main soil nutrients, waterlogging, soil movement, number of avalanches, level of denudation, winter dieback, herbivory, wind damage, and days with frost were measured or observed. The present study revealed that 82\% of the variance in vascular species richness among sites could be explained by just two abiotic factors, daily maximum temperature and soil {pH}. Daily maximum temperature and {pH} affect species richness both directly and via their effects on other environmental variables. Some stress and disturbance factors were related to species richness in a monotonic way, others in an unimodal way. Monotonic relationships suggest that the harsher the environment is, the fewer species can survive in such habitats. In cases of unimodal relationships ({ISH} and {IDH}) species richness decreases at both ends of the gradients due to the harsh environment and/or the interaction of other environmental factors. Competition and disturbance seemed only to play a secondary role in the form of fine-tuning species richness in specific communities. Thus, we concluded that neither the {ISH} nor the {IDH} can be considered useful conceptual models for the alpine zone. Furthermore, we found that standing crop can be used as an easily measurable surrogate for causal factors determining species richness in the alpine zone, even though there is no direct causality.},

	abstract = {Local persistence of plant species in the face of climate change is largely mediated by genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. In species with a wide altitudinal range, population responses to global warming are likely to differ at contrasting elevations. In controlled climate chambers, we investigated the responses of low and high elevation populations (1200 and 1800 m a.s.l.) of three nutrient-poor grassland species, Trifolium montanum, Ranunculus bulbosus, and Briza media, to ambient and elevated temperature. We measured growth-related, reproductive and phenological traits, evaluated differences in trait plasticity and examined whether trait values or plasticities were positively related to approximate fitness and thus under selection. Elevated temperature induced plastic responses in several growth-related traits of all three species. Although flowering phenology was advanced in T. montanum and R. bulbosus, number of flowers and reproductive allocation were not increased under elevated temperature. Plasticity differed between low and high elevation populations only in leaf traits of T. montanum and B. media. Some growth-related and phenological traits were under selection. Moreover, plasticities were not correlated with approximate fitness indicating selectively neutral plastic responses to elevated temperature. The observed plasticity in growth-related and phenological traits, albeit variable among species, suggests that plasticity is an important mechanism in mediating plant responses to elevated temperature. However, the capacity of species to respond to climate change through phenotypic plasticity is limited suggesting that the species additionally need evolutionary adaptation to adjust to climate change. The observed selection on several growth-related and phenological traits indicates that the study species have the potential for future evolution in the context of a warming climate.},

	abstract = {In the alpine landscape, characterized by high spatiotemporal heterogeneity and barriers, divergent selection is likely to lead to local adaptation of plant populations either through adaptive genetic differentiation or through phenotypic plasticity. The relative importance of these processes has rarely been investigated in relation to the spatial scale of environmental heterogeneity. In this study, we used reciprocal transplantation experiments of populations across nearby and distant field sites to shed light on these complementary processes.
We reciprocally transplanted populations of the widespread alpine grass, Poa alpina, within and across regions in the Swiss Alps. We inferred local adaptation at the metapopulation level by comparing fitness of plants transplanted to their site of origin and to nearby or distant novel sites. Additionally, we measured specific leaf area ({SLA}) and performed selection analyses to investigate directional selection on mean trait value at each field site and on the degree of plasticity of this trait to assess whether plastic responses were adaptive. In parallel, all populations were genotyped with microsatellite markers to assess neutral molecular differentiation.
Molecular differentiation was high among populations within and among regions, indicating restricted gene flow among P. alpina populations. Reproductive biomass was highest in individuals grown in their region of origin, revealing local adaptation to coarse-grained environmental variability. Similarly, inflorescence height, associated with reproductive biomass, reflected adaptation to fine- and coarse-grained environmental variability. Furthermore, we found evidence that plasticity in {SLA} across coarse-grained habitats was correlated with plant fitness, suggesting that plasticity in this trait is adaptive.
Synthesis. Our results revealed adaptive genetic differentiation between P. alpina populations in the Swiss Alps reflecting local adaptation. Furthermore, high phenotypic plasticity in {SLA} contributed to the maintenance of fitness homoeostasis across habitats. Hence, adaptive genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity play a complementary role for adaption of P. alpina to environmental heterogeneity in the Swiss Alps and both may be critical to mitigate local extinction risk under rapid climate change.},

Substantial intraspecific variation in {SLA} is common and usually correlates with environmental conditions. For instance, {SLA} decreases with increasing altitude, which is understood as adjustment to temperature. It is generally assumed that intraspecific variation is mostly the result of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, but genetic effects may also be present, due to local adaptation or genetic drift. In this study, genotypic and environmental effects on {SLA} were experimentally separated for the widespread Alpine bell flower Campanula thyrsoides by transplanting plants to three common gardens at contrasting altitudes (600, 1,235 and 1,850 m a.s.l.). Seeds were sampled from 18 populations in four phylogeographic regions within the European Alps. A strong plastic response was observed: {SLA} decreased with increasing altitude of the common gardens (22.0\% of variation). The phylogeographic regions were differentiated in {SLA} in the common gardens (10.1\% of variation), indicating that {SLA} is at least partly genetically determined. Plants from the six easternmost populations experienced a submediterranean climate and showed decreased {SLA} values in the three common gardens compared to populations to the west, which may be explained as adaptation to drought. Within these submediterranean populations, {SLA} decreased with altitude of origin in two out of three common gardens. Concluding, {SLA} shows strong phenotypic plasticity as well as substantial genetic effects, the latter probably being the result of adaptation to local conditions rather than genetic drift.},

We used reduced major axis ({RMA}) regression and general linear models ({GLM}) to perform data analysis.

Leaf temperature ({TL}) of all species was adjusted within the range 13–30 °C using the Peltier thermoelectric cooler. The temperature responses of metabolic processes were subsequently modelled using the Arrhenius exponential function involving the temperature coefficient Q10. The expected increase of global temperature led to a significant increase of dark respiration rate ({RD}; Q10 = 2.0±0.5), maximum carboxylation rate ({VCmax}; Q10 = 2.2±0.6), and maximum electron transport rate (Jmax; Q10 = 1.6±0.4) in dominant species of mountain grassland ecosystems. Contrariwise, the ratio between Jmax and {VCmax} linearly decreased with {TL} [y = −0.884 {TL} + 5.24; r2 = 0.78]. Hence temperature did not control the ratio between intercellular and ambient {CO}2 concentration, apparent quantum efficiency, and photon-saturated {CO}2 assimilation rate (Pmax). Pmax primarily correlated with maximum stomatal conductance irrespective of {TL}. Water use efficiency tended to decrease with {TL} [y = −0.21 {TL} + 8.1; r2 = 0.87].},

	abstract = {*
Species coexistence requires differential response to inter- and intraspecific competition, typically conceptualized as niche differentiation. Coexistence of close relatives therefore poses an interesting scenario with regards to niche differentiation since these species generally have many traits in common due to shared ancestry. Native Californian Trifolium assemblages are locally diverse and represent a unique system for understanding competitive interactions among close relatives.



*
We conducted two similar greenhouse studies in which Trifolium fucatum was grown alone, with a conspecific competitor, and with a congeneric competitor (Trifolium macraei). In the first study, we assessed biomass production in T. fucatum, and in the second study we conducted an {RNAseq} analysis of T. fucatum roots to test for differentially expressed genes that may mediate competitive interactions and potentially coexistence.



*
Compared to plants grown alone, competition (i.e. growth in the same pot) with a conspecific resulted in a greater reduction in biomass than competition with a congener, as predicted by theory. However, competition with a congener resulted in twice as many differentially expressed genes as competition with a conspecific.



*
Annotations of identified genes differentiating congeneric from conspecific competition suggest several functions attributed to interactions with third-party organisms, including nodulation with rhizobial mutualists, and defence responses against pathogens and herbivores. In addition, salt-responsive genes and an iron transporter were differentially expressed in congeneric competition, and comparisons of sodium and iron concentrations in field soils where these species are found showed that T. fucatum occurs in higher sodium and iron microsites than T. macraei. Thus, the transcriptome highlighted abiotic niche axes worth pursuing in future ecological experiments as potential mediators of coexistence.



*
We also found a subset of genes that responded similarly to both congeneric and conspecific competition in both direction and magnitude, indicating some conserved responses to competition, regardless of neighbour identity.



*
Synthesis. Transcriptomic analyses represent novel tools for identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions among species. Working iteratively with ecological experimentation and observation, transcriptomes may allow us to identify novel dimensions of the n-dimensional niche that determine species’ distributions and their ability to coexist.},

Using multispecies population models fit to long-term demographic data for common, co-occurring species in five grassland and shrubland plant communities in western North America, we estimated the strength of stabilizing niche differences and average fitness differences. In all five communities, both pairwise and full community comparisons showed evidence for strong stabilizing mechanisms and relatively small average fitness differences. For a total of 17 species pairs, a measure of niche differences based on simulations of invasion growth rates ranged from 0.59 to 0.93 with a mean of 0.81, where 0 indicates complete niche overlap and 1 indicates zero niche overlap. A corresponding measure of average fitness differences ranged from 1.02 to 2.54 with a mean of 1.53, where 1 indicates identical fitness and a value of 2 indicates a fourfold difference in sensitivity to competition. Comparisons of full communities displayed similar patterns: niche differences ranged from 0.58 to 0.69 with a mean of 0.64, and the average fitness differences ranged from 1.42 to 1.63 with a mean of 1.47. In almost every case, the stabilizing mechanisms were much stronger than minimally necessary to prevent competitive exclusion. Considering that all but one of the species we studied are perennial grasses, which are often grouped in the same functional type, the magnitude of these niche differences is surprising. In all five communities, differences between intra- and interspecific effects at the recruitment stage contributed far more to stabilization than interactions affecting growth and survival. Our results indicate that for these abundant, co-occurring species (1) dynamics are far from neutral, with strong niche differences and weak fitness differences combining to stabilize coexistence, and (2) processes operating at early life stages account for a large proportion of the stabilizing effect. Given the limitations of our inductive approach, both these findings represent hypotheses in need of experimental testing.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

	abstract = {* For plants competing for light, grasslands represent complex environments. Grassland microhabitats vary in the amount of available light and in the spatial distribution of patches with full sunlight, light shade and deep shade. Plant populations have been shown to adapt to specific competitors and shading conditions, but it is an open question how tightly the responses of populations to different shading situations are linked to the light availability previously experienced in the field.


* Using maternal families collected in grasslands ranging from open to closed canopies, I tested the effects of no shading, homogeneous and heterogeneous shade created in the glasshouse on trait expression in the annual Erodium cicutarium. Heterogeneous shading was simulated by a patchwork of single and double layers of light filters lowering the R:{FR} ratio of transmitted light and clear filters simulating gaps.


* Heterogeneous shading induced a stronger shade avoidance response than homogeneous shading, with larger leaf length, greater vegetative height and larger specific leaf area. Time to first flowering was longer under heterogeneous shading, and plants produced less fruits.


* Populations differed in their time to first flowering under the shading treatments, and these differences could be traced back to light availability measured in the field. Plants from populations with lower light availability showed a postponed date of first flowering even if they were not shaded. These differences were attributable to plasticity of the maternal families. Across shading treatments, plants from low-light environments produced more above-ground biomass.


* Synthesis. This study indicates that there is a close linkage between the light availability experienced in the field and the ability of following generations to respond to shading. Low average light availability experienced in the past seems to induce a trade-off of vegetative growth against early flowering, providing the following generations with the capacity to overtop neighbours. This capacity is utilized especially if plants experience a mixture of gaps and deep shade.},

Leaf transverse sections of seven annual-perennial pairs of grass species grown in the laboratory were analyzed to elucidate the anatomical bases of these differences. Leaf thickness was similar in annuals and perennials, but leaf density was significantly higher in perennials. The proportion of the leaf volume occupied by mesophyll was higher in annuals, at the expense of the three other tissues (i.e. epidermis, sclerenchyma and vascular tissues). The cross-sectional area of mesophyll cells was higher in annuals than in perennials, but epidermal cell size was similar for both life-forms. The ranges of {LSM} (23.1–49.5 g m −2) and {LWC} (0.70–0.86 g g−1) displayed by the 14 species were large enough to examine the general relationships between these two parameters and various anatomical characters. {LSM} was significantly correlated with leaf density, but not with leaf thickness. The anatomical character that best explained interspecific differences in {LSM} was the volume of cell walls per unit leaf area (approximated by the sum: sclerenchyma + vascular tissues (including its living component) + cell wall components of mesophyll and epidermis). {LWC} was found to depend on leaf density, and interspecific differences in this parameter were best explained by the proportion of mesophyll protoplast (i.e. proportion of mesophyll minus proportion of mesophyll occupied by cell walls) in the transverse sections. The physiological and ecological implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a trade-off between leaf productivity and persistence.},

Although ecologists have long acknowledged species/' direct physiological and demographic responses to climate, more recent work suggests that these direct responses can be overwhelmed by indirect effects mediated via other interacting community members. Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate. Empirical tests of this prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing interactions between competitors that co-occur today. To explore how species/' responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species/' responses to climate change accurately.},

Methods

Large herbivores were experimentally excluded from three sites (50 m × 50 m exclusion fences) during 9 yr in a productive semi-natural grassland system with a long history of grazing, using adjacent grazed plots as experimental controls. Sampling was carried out by systematically placing 100 quadrats (0.5 m × 0.5 m) in each of the six plots. Floristic composition and abundance, as well as eight hydrological and chemical soil properties, were measured in each quadrat. The spatial structures created by competitive species were analysed using {RDA} in conjunction with Moran's eigenvector maps, and soil variables were simultaneously included in the analyses, thus disentangling the structures likely created by niche effects. Competitive exclusion was further determined using linear regressions between species richness and abundance of competitive species.


Results

Grazing exclusion unleashed competitive species such as Festuca microphylla and Agrostis capillaris, which became dominant in the exclusion plots and created large spatial patches. Furthermore, a negative linear relationship, consistent across exclusion plots, was observed between species richness and abundance of competitive species, indicating that strong above-ground competitors outcompeted other species when herbivores were excluded. However, the outcome of grazing exclusion across sites depended to some extent on local environmental conditions (niche effects).


Conclusions

This work confirms that the powerful equalizing mechanism of disturbance by herbivores is crucial for species co-existence in productive grasslands. However, important differences observed in environmental effects across sites suggest that, even in highly productive grasslands, plant traits and local environmental characteristics (niche effects) do matter for species co-existence.},

	abstract = {Process-based models ({PBM}) for simulation of weather dependent grass growth can assist farmers and plant breeders in addressing the challenges of climate change by simulating alternative roads of adaptation. They can also provide management decision support under current conditions. A drawback of existing grass models is that they do not take into account the effect of winter stresses, limiting their use for full-year simulations in areas where winter survival is a key factor for yield security. Here, we present a novel full-year {PBM} for grassland named {BASGRA}. It was developed by combining the {LINGRA} grassland model (Van Oijen et al., 2005a) with models for cold hardening and soil physical winter processes. We present the model and show how it was parameterized for timothy (Phleum pratense L.), the most important forage grass in Scandinavia and parts of North America and Asia. Uniquely, {BASGRA} simulates the processes taking place in the sward during the transition from summer to winter, including growth cessation and gradual cold hardening, and functions for simulating plant injury due to low temperatures, snow and ice affecting regrowth in spring. For the calibration, we used detailed data from five different locations in Norway, covering a wide range of agroclimatic regions, day lengths (latitudes from 59° to 70° N) and soil conditions. The total dataset included 11 variables, notably above-ground dry matter, leaf area index, tiller density, content of C reserves, and frost tolerance. All data were used in the calibration. When {BASGRA} was run with the maximum a-posteriori ({MAP}) parameter vector from the single, Bayesian calibration, nearly all measured variables were simulated to an overall normalized root mean squared error ({NRMSE}) \&lt; 0.5. For many site × experiment combinations, {NRMSE} was \&lt;0.3. The temporal dynamics were captured well for most variables, as evaluated by comparing simulated time courses versus data for the individual sites. The results may suggest that {BASGRA} is a reasonably robust model, allowing for simulation of growth and several important underlying processes with acceptable accuracy for a range of agroclimatic conditions. However, the robustness of the model needs to be tested further using independent data from a wide range of growing conditions. Finally we show an example of application of the model, comparing overwintering risks in two climatically different sites, and discuss future model applications. Further development work should include improved simulation of the dynamics of C reserves, and validation of winter tiller dynamics against independent data.},

In vulnerable habitats, introduction of more drought-tolerant provenances or species is currently considered to accelerate tree species migration and facilitate forest persistence. Trade-offs between drought adaptation and growth plasticity might, however, limit the effectiveness of assisted migration, especially if introductions focus on provenances or species from different climatic regions. We tested in a common garden experiment the performance of Pinus sylvestris seedlings from the continental Central Alps under increased temperatures and extended spring and/or summer drought, and compared seedling emergence, survival and biomass allocation to that of P. sylvestris and closely related Pinus nigra from a Mediterranean seed source. Soil heating had only minor effects on seedling performance but high spring precipitation doubled the number of continental P. sylvestris seedlings present after the summer drought. At the same time, twice as many seedlings of the Mediterranean than the continental P. sylvestris provenance were present, which was due to both higher emergence and lower mortality under dry conditions. Both P. sylvestris provenances allocated similar amounts of biomass to roots when grown under low summer precipitation. Mediterranean seedlings, however, revealed lower phenotypic plasticity than continental seedlings under high precipitation, which might limit their competitive ability in continental Alpine forests in non-drought years. By contrast, high variability in the response of individual seedlings to summer drought indicates the potential of continental P. sylvestris provenances to adapt to changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare—the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

	abstract = {How expected increases in climate variability will affect species diversity depends on the role of such variability in regulating the coexistence of competing species. Despite theory linking temporal environmental fluctuations with the maintenance of diversity, the importance of climate variability for stabilizing coexistence remains unknown because of a lack of appropriate long-term observations. Here, we analyze three decades of demographic data from a Kansas prairie to demonstrate that interannual climate variability promotes the coexistence of three common grass species. Specifically, we show that (i) the dynamics of the three species satisfy all requirements of “storage effect” theory based on recruitment variability with overlapping generations, (ii) climate variables are correlated with interannual variation in species performance, and (iii) temporal variability increases low-density growth rates, buffering these species against competitive exclusion. Given that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous in natural systems, our results suggest that coexistence based on the storage effect may be underappreciated and could provide an important alternative to recent neutral theories of diversity. Field evidence for positive effects of variability on coexistence also emphasizes the need to consider changes in both climate means and variances when forecasting the effects of global change on species diversity.},

	abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

	abstract = {Plants grow in dynamic environments where they can be exposed to a multitude of stressful factors, all of which affect their development, yield, and, ultimately, reproductive success. Plants are adept at rapidly acclimating to stressful conditions and are able to further fortify their defenses by retaining memories of stress to enable stronger or more rapid responses should an environmental perturbation recur. Indeed, one mechanism that is often evoked regarding environmental memories is epigenetics. Yet, there are relatively few examples of such memories; neither is there a clear understanding of their duration, considering the plethora of stresses in nature. We propose that this field would benefit from investigations into the processes and mechanisms enabling recovery from stress. An understanding of stress recovery could provide fresh insights into when, how, and why environmental memories are created and regulated. Stress memories may be maladaptive, hindering recovery and affecting development and potential yield. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous for plants to learn to forget. Accordingly, the recovery process entails a balancing act between resetting and memory formation. During recovery, {RNA} metabolism, posttranscriptional gene silencing, and {RNA}-directed {DNA} methylation have the potential to play key roles in resetting the epigenome and transcriptome and in altering memory. Exploration of this emerging area of research is becoming ever more tractable with advances in genomics, phenomics, and high-throughput sequencing methodology that will enable unprecedented profiling of high-resolution stress recovery time series experiments and sampling of large natural populations.

Measuring species pool size and the proportion realised locally (completeness) may clarify diversity-invasion relationships by separating environmental and biotic effects, especially if species’ life-history stage and origin are accounted for. To test these relationships, we added seeds and transplants of 15 native and alien species into 29 grasslands. Species pool size and completeness explained more variation in invasion than richness alone. Although results varied between native and alien species, seed establishment and biotic resistance to transplants increased with species pool size, whereas transplant growth and biotic resistance to seeds increased with completeness. Consequently, species pools and completeness represent multiple independent processes affecting invasion; accounting for these processes improves our understanding of invasion.},

A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt from pauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.},

Current methods could benefit from a model-based probabilistic framework that accommodates covariance between traits and quantifies contributions from inherent trait syndromes, species interactions, and responses to the environment. I develop a model-based approach that separates these effects on trait diversity. Application to {USDA} Forest Inventory and Analysis ({FIA}) data in the eastern United States demonstrates an apparent paradox, that the analysis of species better explains and predicts traits than does direct analysis of the traits themselves; trait data contain less, not more, information than species on environmental responses. Whereas variation in some traits is dominated by inherent syndromes (tendency for certain traits to be associated with others within an individual and species), others are strongly controlled by variation in species diversity. There is substantial variation in environmental control on trait patterns, between traits and regionally. In terms of environmental response traits do not aggregate into defined plant functional types, as would be desirable for models.},

	abstract = {* Trait differences among plants are expected to influence the outcome of competition; competition should be strongest between similar species (or individuals) under limiting similarity, and between dissimilar species within competitive hierarchies. These hypotheses are often used to infer competitive dynamics from trait patterns within communities. However, plant traits are frequently plastic in response to competition. This variation is poorly accounted for in trait-based studies of competition and community assembly.


* To explore the relationship between trait responses and competitive outcomes, we grew 15 species alone, in monoculture and in mixture. We measured traits relating to leaf and root tissue morphology as well as biomass allocation and related competition-induced changes in these traits to intra- and interspecific competition using multi-model inference. Additionally, we tested how traits from different competitive environments influenced potential community assembly inferences.


* The competitive environment had large effects on species’ traits, although many effects were species specific. Differences among species in how competition affected trait expression were linked to both intra- and interspecific competition, frequently affecting competitive hierarchies. Intraspecific competition was lower for species that limited competition-induced increases in root allocation and had less variability in this trait overall. Interspecific competition was lower for species with larger leaves and lower specific leaf area than their neighbours. Switching to more stress-tolerant strategies by increasing root diameter and leaf tissue density also reduced competition. However, dissimilarity in root tissue density also minimized competition, consistent with limiting similarity affecting competitive outcomes. Moreover, changes in these traits were linked to changes in functional diversity, suggesting that competition affects functional diversity by affecting trait expression.


* Synthesis. Both trait hierarchies and trait dissimilarity affect the outcome of competition by acting on different traits, although competition-induced changes in trait expression can alter competitive outcomes. Moreover, the magnitude of these trait changes suggests that the source environment where plant traits are collected can affect the inferences drawn from trait patterns within communities. Combined, our results suggest that considering the effect of competition on trait expression is critical to understanding the relationship between traits and community assembly.},

Plants respond with changes in phenology, physiology, and reproduction, with consequences for biotic interactions and community composition. We review information on phenotypic plasticity, a primary means by which plants cope with global change scenarios, recommending promising approaches for investigating the evolution of plasticity and describing constraints to its evolution. We discuss the important but largely ignored role of phenotypic plasticity in range shifts and review the extensive literature on invasive species as models of evolutionary change in novel environments. Plasticity can play a role both in the short-term response of plant populations to global change as well as in their long-term fate through the maintenance of genetic variation. In new environmental conditions, plasticity of certain functional traits may be beneficial (i.e., the plastic response is accompanied by a fitness advantage) and thus selected for. Plasticity can also be relevant in the establishment and persistence of plants in novel environments that are crucial for populations at the colonizing edge in range shifts induced by climate change. Experimental studies show taxonomically widespread plastic responses to global change drivers in many functional traits, though there is a lack of empirical support for many theoretical models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Future studies should assess the adaptive value and evolutionary potential of plasticity under complex, realistic global change scenarios. Promising tools include resurrection protocols and artificial selection experiments.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait-mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change.},

	abstract = {* In the alpine landscape, characterized by high spatiotemporal heterogeneity and barriers, divergent selection is likely to lead to local adaptation of plant populations either through adaptive genetic differentiation or through phenotypic plasticity. The relative importance of these processes has rarely been investigated in relation to the spatial scale of environmental heterogeneity. In this study, we used reciprocal transplantation experiments of populations across nearby and distant field sites to shed light on these complementary processes.


* We reciprocally transplanted populations of the widespread alpine grass, Poa alpina, within and across regions in the Swiss Alps. We inferred local adaptation at the metapopulation level by comparing fitness of plants transplanted to their site of origin and to nearby or distant novel sites. Additionally, we measured specific leaf area ({SLA}) and performed selection analyses to investigate directional selection on mean trait value at each field site and on the degree of plasticity of this trait to assess whether plastic responses were adaptive. In parallel, all populations were genotyped with microsatellite markers to assess neutral molecular differentiation.


* Molecular differentiation was high among populations within and among regions, indicating restricted gene flow among P. alpina populations. Reproductive biomass was highest in individuals grown in their region of origin, revealing local adaptation to coarse-grained environmental variability. Similarly, inflorescence height, associated with reproductive biomass, reflected adaptation to fine- and coarse-grained environmental variability. Furthermore, we found evidence that plasticity in {SLA} across coarse-grained habitats was correlated with plant fitness, suggesting that plasticity in this trait is adaptive.


* Synthesis. Our results revealed adaptive genetic differentiation between P. alpina populations in the Swiss Alps reflecting local adaptation. Furthermore, high phenotypic plasticity in {SLA} contributed to the maintenance of fitness homoeostasis across habitats. Hence, adaptive genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity play a complementary role for adaption of P. alpina to environmental heterogeneity in the Swiss Alps and both may be critical to mitigate local extinction risk under rapid climate change.},

To address these questions, we quantified the variation and covariation of four leaf economic traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents) in a cosmopolitan wetland species (Phragmites australis) at three spatial (inter-regional, regional and site) scales across most of the species range in China. The species expressed large intraspecific variation in the leaf economic traits at all of the three spatial scales. It also showed strong covariation among the four leaf economic traits across the species range. The coordination among leaf economic traits resulted in {LES} at all three scales and the environmental variables determining variation in leaf economic traits were different among the spatial scales. Our results provide novel evidence for within-species {LES} at multiple spatial scales, indicating that resource trade-off could also constrain intraspecific trait variation mainly driven by climatic and/or edaphic differences.},

This could be because plasticity is advantageous under some conditions and disadvantageous or not advantageous under others.

It seems reasonable to hypothesize that selection is likely to favor plasticity when an environmental factor varies on the same spatial scale as the plant response unit, when the plant can respond to an environmental factor faster than the level of the factor changes, and when environmental variation is highly but not completely predictable. Phenotypic plasticity might also tend to be more advantageous when mean resource availability is high rather than low, when a response can occur late in development rather than early, and when a response is reversible rather than irreversible. There is substantial evidence for the hypothesis that predictability favors plasticity. However, available evidence does not support the hypothesis that high mean resource availability necessarily favors plasticity. Testing hypotheses about when it is good for a plant to adjust is central to understanding the diversity of plasticity in plants.},

Using a combination of empirical data, mechanistic models, and statistical tools, we develop innovative methods to test for the isolated and combined effects of architectural and temporal niche differences among species as well as plastic changes in crown shape within species. We show that all three mechanisms enhanced light capture in mixtures and that temporal niche differences were the most important driver of this result in our seasonal tropical system.

However, if such adaptational lag has occurred, immigrants from historically warmer climates will outperform natives and may provide genetic potential for evolutionary rescue. We tested for lagging adaptation to warming climate using banked seeds of the annual weed Arabidopsis thaliana in common garden experiments in four sites across the species' native European range: Valencia, Spain; Norwich, United Kingdom; Halle, Germany; and Oulu, Finland. Genotypes originating from geographic regions near the planting site had high relative fitness in each site, direct evidence for broad-scale geographic adaptation in this model species. However, genotypes originating in sites historically warmer than the planting site had higher average relative fitness than local genotypes in every site, especially at the northern range limit in Finland. This result suggests that local adaptive optima have shifted rapidly with recent warming across the species' native range. Climatic optima also differed among seasonal germination cohorts within the Norwich site, suggesting that populations occurring where summer germination is common may have greater evolutionary potential to persist under future warming. If adaptational lag has occurred over just a few decades in banked seeds of an annual species, it may be an important consideration for managing longer-lived species, as well as for attempts to conserve threatened populations through ex situ preservation.},

This review distinguishes two conceptually distinct types of costs: phenotypic costs and plasticity costs. Phenotypic costs are assessed from patterns of covariation, typically between a focal trait and a separate trait relevant to fitness. Plasticity costs, separable from phenotypic costs, are gauged by comparing the fitness of genotypes with equivalent phenotypes within two environments but differing in plasticity and fitness. Subtleties associated with both types of costs are illustrated by a body of work addressing predator-induced plasticity. Such subtleties, and potential interplay between the two types of costs, have also been addressed, often in studies involving genetic model organisms. In some instances, investigators have pinpointed the mechanistic basis of plasticity. In this vein, microbial work is especially illuminating and has three additional strengths. First, information about the machinery underlying plasticity—such as structural and regulatory genes, sensory proteins, and biochemical pathways—helps link population-level studies with underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms. Second, microbial studies involve many generations, large populations, and replication. Finally, empirical estimation of key parameters (e.g., mutation rates) is tractable. Together, these allow for rigorous investigation of gene interactions, drift, mutation, and selection—all potential factors influencing the maintenance or loss of inducible traits along with phenotypic and plasticity costs. Messages emerging from microbial work can guide future efforts to understand the evolution of plastic traits in diverse organisms.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Phenotypically plastic organisms display alternative phenotypes in different environments. It is widely appreciated that possessing alternative phenotypes can affect fitness. However, some investigators have suggested that simply carrying the ability to be plastic could also affect fitness. Evolutionary models suggest that high costs of plasticity could constrain the evolution of optimal phenotypes. However, costs (and limits) of plasticity are primarily hypothetical. Little empirical evidence exists to show that increased plasticity leads to reduced growth and development, leads to increased developmental instability, or limits the ability of organisms to produce more extreme phenotypes. I used half‐sib families of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) reared in outdoor mesocosms to examine how tadpoles altered behavioral, morphological, and life‐historical traits in response to larval dragonfly predators (Anax longipes). The predators induced lower activity and the development of relatively large tails and small bodies in wood frogs. As a result, wood frogs experienced reduced growth and development. I then examined whether tadpole sibships with higher plasticity experienced fitness costs (above and beyond the costs of expressing a particular phenotype) and whether they were limited in producing extreme phenotypes. Fitness effects of plasticity were widespread. Depending on the trait examined and the environment experienced, increased plasticity had either positive effects, negative effects, or no effects on tadpole mass, development, and survivorship. I found no relationship between increased plasticity and greater developmental instability. There was also no evidence that sibships with increased plasticity produced less extreme phenotypes; the most extreme trait states were always produced by the most plastic genotypes. This work suggests that costs of plasticity may be pervasive in nature and may substantially impact the evolution of optimal phenotypes in organisms that live in heterogeneous environments.},

More precisely, we tested the theoretical prediction that plasticity is most likely to evolve if alternative environments (in this case, different neighbour species) are common and encountered at similar frequencies.


* We estimated the frequencies of encountering different neighbour species in the field for 27 grassland species and measured the aboveground morphological responses of each species to conspecific vs heterospecific neighbours in a common garden.


* Responses to neighbour identity were dependent on how frequently the experimental neighbours were encountered by the focal species in their home community, with the greatest plasticity observed in species that encountered both neighbours (conspecific and heterospecific) with high and even frequency.


* Biotic interactions with neighbouring species can impose selection on plasticity in functional traits, which may feed back through trait divergence and niche differentiation to influence species coexistence and community structure.},

	abstract = {(1)
Ecohydrological models of savanna rangeland systems typically aggregate plant species to very broad plant functional types ({PFTs}), which are characterized by their trait combinations. However, neglecting trait variability within modelled {PFTs} may hamper our ability to understand the effects of climate or land use change on vegetation composition and thus on ecosystem processes.
(2)
In this study we extended and parameterized the ecohydrological savanna model {EcoHyD}, which originally considered only three broad {PFTs} (perennial grasses, annuals and shrubs). We defined several sub-types of perennial grasses (sub-{PFTs}) to assess the effect of environmental conditions on vegetation composition and ecosystem functioning. These perennial sub-{PFTs} are defined by altering distinct trait values based on a trade-off approach for (i) the longevity of plants and (ii) grazing-resistance.
(3)
We find that increasing grazing intensity leads to a dominance of the fast-growing and short-lived perennial grass type as well as a dominance of the poorly palatable grass type. Increasing precipitation dampens the magnitude of grazing-induced shifts between perennial grass types. The diversification of perennial grass {PFTs} generally increases the total perennial grass cover and ecosystem water use efficiency, but does not protect the community from shrub encroachment.
(4)
We thus demonstrate that including trait heterogeneity into ecosystem models will allow for an improved representation of ecosystem responses to environmental change in savannas. This will help to better assess how ecosystem functions might be impacted under future conditions.},

Summary

This review considers the relationship between the lifespan of an individual plant and the longevity of its component cells, tissues and organs. It begins by defining the terms senescence, growth, development, turnover, ageing, death and program. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulating phase change from juvenility to maturity influence directly the capacity for responding to senescence signals and factors determining reproduction-related patterns of deteriorative ageing and death. Senescence is responsive to communication between sources and sinks in which sugar signalling and hormonal regulation play central roles. Monocarpy and polycarpy represent contrasting outcomes of the balance between the determinacy of apical meristems and source–sink cross-talk. Even extremely long-lived perennials sustain a high degree of meristem integrity. Factors associated with deteriorative ageing in animals, such as somatic mutation, telomere attrition and the costs of repair and maintenance, do not seem to be particularly significant for plant lifespan, but autophagy-related regulatory networks integrated with nutrient signalling may have a part to play. Size is an important influence on physiological function and fitness of old trees. Self-control of modular structure allows trees to sustain viability over prolonged lifespans. Different turnover patterns of structural modules can account for the range of plant life histories and longevities.},

	abstract = {• Background and Aims In a leaf canopy, there is a turnover of leaves; i.e. they are produced, senesce and fall. These processes determine the amount of leaf area in the canopy, which in turn determines canopy photosynthesis. The turnover rate of leaves is affected by environmental factors and is different among species. This mini-review discusses factors responsible for leaf dynamics in plant canopies, focusing on the role of nitrogen.
• Scope Leaf production is supported by canopy photosynthesis that is determined by distribution of light and leaf nitrogen. Leaf nitrogen determines photosynthetic capacity. Nitrogen taken up from roots is allocated to new leaves. When leaves age or their light availability is lowered, part of the leaf nitrogen is resorbed. Resorbed nitrogen is re-utilized in new organs and the rest is lost with dead leaves. The sink–source balance is important in the regulation of leaf senescence. Several models have been proposed to predict response to environmental changes. A mathematical model that incorporated nitrogen use for photosynthesis explained well the variations in leaf lifespan within and between species.
• Conclusion When leaf turnover is at a steady state, the ratio of biomass production to nitrogen uptake is equal to the ratio of litter fall to nitrogen loss, which is an inverse of the nitrogen concentration in dead leaves. Thus nitrogen concentration in dead leaves (nitrogen resorption proficiency) and nitrogen availability in the soil determine the rate of photosynthesis in the canopy. Dynamics of leaves are regulated so as to maximize carbon gain and resource-use efficiency of the plant.},

Time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVIint}), used as a surrogate for aboveground primary productivity, and snow cover duration were derived from a 13-year long time series of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}). A regional-scale meteorological forcing that accounted for topographical effects was provided by the {SAFRAN}–{CROCUS}–{MEPRA} model chain. A hierarchical path analysis was developed to analyze the multivariate causal relationships between forcing variables and proxies of primary productivity. Inter-annual variations in primary productivity were primarily governed by year-to-year variations in the length of the snow-free period and to a much lesser extent by temperature and precipitation during the growing season. A prolonged snow cover reduces the number and magnitude of frost events during the initial growth period but this has a negligible impact on {NDVIint} as compared to the strong negative effect of a delayed snow melting. The maximum {NDVI} slightly responded to increased summer precipitation and temperature but the impact on productivity was weak. The period spanning from peak standing biomass to the first snowfall accounted for two-thirds of {NDVIint} and this explained the high sensitivity of {NDVIint} to autumn temperature and autumn rainfall that control the timing of the first snowfall. The ability of mountain plants to maintain green tissues during the whole snow-free period along with the relatively low responsiveness of peak standing biomass to summer meteorological conditions led to the conclusion that the length of the snow-free period is the primary driver of the inter-annual variations in primary productivity of mountain grasslands.},

We aim to understand how these two variables vary throughout the growing season in sub-alpine grasslands. How do productivity and phenology (quality) of different plant communities within a landscape vary over time? Do productivity and phenology co-vary? Which environmental constraints or growth form composition best explain differences in productivity and phenology among plant communities? Location Calcareous sub-alpine grasslands, the external Alps, France. Methods We assessed how productivity (above-ground biomass) and phenology varied with date, slope, radiation and altitude among seven plant communities. Then we explored (1) co-variation among maximum biomass, the date of maximum biomass and average community flowering date for each plant community, and (2) whether these variables were related to snow regime or growth form composition. Results Temporal dynamics of biomass and phenology varied markedly among plant communities. More productive communities reached their maximum biomass later. Flowering occurred after the biomass peak, except for one plant community. However, the later the biomass peak, the shorter the lag to flowering peak. The timing of flowering and date of maximum biomass were best explained by differences in snow regimes among communities. The impact of growth form composition was marginal. Conclusions Plant communities are under strong time constraints to grow and flower. Snowmelt regime plays a crucial role at one end of the growing season, while time left for fruiting and maturing is likely to influence the other end. Sub-alpine grassland communities are highly heterogeneous in productivity, timing of maximum productivity and flowering phenology, creating small-scale variability in the forage quality and quantity available to large herbivores.},

	abstract = {* What is the relative importance of environmental filtering and competition in community assembly and invasion? At large spatial scales and for species-rich systems, this question can be answered by studying functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns. The greater availability of community composition surveys, functional trait data bases and/or phylogenies from across a wide range of ecosystems has led to a significant increase in studies based on the analysis of diversity patterns. However, the underlying conceptual and methodological assumptions have recently been put into question, requiring rigorous evaluation of their reliability.


* In order to test these underlying assumptions, we need to be able to compare diversity patterns with their true underlying processes. For empirical data, we usually do not know these underlying processes, but for virtual data generated by simulation models, this information is available. Using two illustrative examples, we introduce {VirtualCom}, a simulation model that generates such data sets. Integrating both ecological and evolutionary processes, {VirtualCom} simulates the evolution of the pool of regionally occurring species, the process-based assembly of native communities and the invasion of novel species into native communities.


* The model provides functionalities for a variety of processes. Most importantly, in the simulation of the species pool, different trait evolution models allow the generation of clustered and random trait distributions in the phylogeny (resulting in varying strength of phylogenetic signal). Additionally, when the species assemble from the species pool into local communities based on their trait values, the relative strength of environmental filtering and competition can be set independently.


* By offering possibilities for a broad range of simulation-based modelling experiments, {VirtualCom} is a simple and readily usable tool that will help to resolve theoretical and methodological issues in community ecology.},

	abstract = {* Population dynamics in forests are strongly size-structured: larger plants shade smaller plants while also expending proportionately more energy on building and maintaining woody stems. Although the importance of size structure for demography is widely recognized, many models either omit it entirely or include only coarse approximations.


* Here, we introduce the plant package, an extensible framework for modelling size- and trait-structured demography, ecology and evolution in simulated forests. At its core, plant is an individual-based model where plant physiology and demography are mediated by traits. Individual plants from multiple species can be grown in isolation, in patches of competing plants or in metapopulations under a disturbance regime. These dynamics can be integrated into metapopulation-level estimates of invasion fitness and vegetation structure. Because fitness emerges as a function of traits, plant provides a novel arena for exploring eco-evolutionary dynamics.


* plant is an open source R package and is available at github.com/traitecoevo/plant. Accessed from R, the core routines in plant are written in C++. The package provides for alternative physiologies and for capturing trade-offs among parameters. A detailed test suite is provided to ensure correct behaviour of the code.


* plant provides a transparent platform for investigating how physiological rules and functional trade-offs interact with competition and disturbance regimes to influence vegetation demography, structure and diversity.},

	abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion ({BM}) model of trait evolution, Abouheif’s Cmean and Pagel’s λ performed well and substantially better than Moran’s I and Blomberg’s K. Pagel’s λ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif’s Cmean. Blomberg’s K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of {BM}, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.},

For many traits, much of this variation is caused by phenotypic plasticity, and thus the impact of plasticity on species coexistence deserves robust quantification. Partly due to a lack of sound theoretical expectations, empirical studies make contradictory claims regarding plasticity effects on coexistence. Our critical review of this literature, framed in modern coexistence theory, reveals that plasticity affects species interactions in ways that could impact stabilizing niche differences and competitive asymmetries. However, almost no study integrates these measures to quantify the net effect of plasticity on species coexistence. To address this challenge, we outline novel empirical approaches grounded in modern theory.},

	abstract = {Several theoretical considerations imply that high shoot morphological plasticity could increase competition symmetry and favour plant coexistence. We tested whether mean plasticity across co-occurring species is a key trait for explaining ramet density and species richness in herbaceous vegetation. We used three data sets to test the hypotheses: (a) experimentally achieved estimates of plasticity to light availability for 35 herbaceous species; (b) richness, ramet density and canopy architecture data from 17 herbaceous communities; (c) species richness data from a 5-year permanent-plot study in a calcareous grassland. In herbaceous communities containing species with relatively higher shoot plasticity, ramet density was significantly higher. Consequently, relatively more species were growing per unit area—a greater proportion of the community species pool was represented on 1 m2. In the permanent plot study species-richness was higher in those 40×40 cm quadrats where species with high shoot plasticity prevailed—there was a positive regression of richness on the mean plasticity of species. This relationship was highly significant in five consecutive years. Our results suggest that shoot plasticity to light availability is evidently one of the key traits in processes that alter the density of co-existing plants and, therefore, species diversity in herbaceous communities.},

The eight root orders showed a broad overlap in diameter, but differences in tissue densities and specific root area ({SRA}) were clearly distinguishable. Thirty per cent of the root branch biomass but 50\% of the surface area ({SA}) was possessed by the first root order, while the fifth accounted for 5\% of the {SA} (20\% biomass). The root order was identified as a determinant of water flux. First-order roots showed a significantly higher rate of water uptake than the second and third root orders, whereas the fourth and fifth root orders showed water excess. The water excess suggested the occurrence of hydraulic redistribution ({HR}) as a result of differences in osmotic potentials. We suggest that plants may utilize hydraulic redistribution to prevent coarse root desiccation and/or to increase nutrient acquisition. Our study showed that the novel ‘miniature depletion chamber’ method enabled direct measurement of water fluxes per root order and can be a major tool for future studies on root order traits.},

The composite transport model integrates apoplastic and cellular components of radial water flow across the root cylinder. It explains why the hydraulic conductivity of roots changes in response to the nature (osmotic vs. hydraulic) and intensity of water flow. The model provides an explanation of the adaptation of plants to conditions of drought and other stresses by allowing for a `coarse regulation of water uptake' according to the demands from the shoot which is favorable to the plant. Coarse regulation is physical in nature, but strongly depends on root anatomy, e.g. on the existence of apoplastic barriers in the exo- and endodermis. Composite transport is based on the composite structure of roots. A `fine regulation' results from the activity of water channels (aquaporins) in root cell membranes which is assumed to be under metabolic and other control.},

This is therefore a generalization of the spherical leaf angle distribution which is frequently used for plant canopies.

However, both herbivore selectivity and the plant’s ability to tolerate or resist herbivory may depend on the density of herbivores. In an alpine ecosystem with a long history of grazing, plants are expected to respond to both enhanced and reduced grazing pressures, and the interaction between plant traits and changes in species abundance are expected to differ between the two types of alteration of grazing regime. To understand the mechanisms behind species response, we investigated the relationship between sheep selectivity (measured in situ), plant traits and experimentally derived measures of change in species abundance as a response to the enhancement (from low to high density) or cessation (from low to zero density) of sheep grazing pressure over a six-year time period for 22 abundant herb species in an alpine habitat in south Norway. Sheep selected large, late-flowering herbs with a low leaf C/N ratio. Species that increased in abundance in response to enhanced grazing pressure were generally small and had high root/shoot ratios, thus exhibiting traits that reflect both resistance (through avoidance) and tolerance (through regrowth capacity) strategies. The abundance of selected species remained stable during the study period, and also under the enhanced grazing pressure treatment. There was, however, a tendency for selected species to respond positively to cessation of grazing, although overall responses to cessation of grazing were much less pronounced than responses to enhanced grazing. Avoidance through short stature (probably associated with increased light availability through the removal of tall competitors) as well as a certain amount of regrowth capacity appear to be the main mechanisms behind a positive response to enhanced grazing pressure in this study. The plant trait perspective clearly improves our insight into the mechanisms behind observed changes in species abundance when the disturbance regime is altered.},

Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species-level competitive differences or substituting for species-level niche differences. These arguments, which are motivating a large body of empirical work, have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three pathways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging, (2) changes in species’ mean interaction strengths because of variation in underlying traits (also via nonlinear averaging) and (3) effects on stochastic demography. As a consequence of the first two mechanisms, we find that intraspecific variation in competitive ability increases the dominance of superior competitors, and intraspecific niche variation reduces species-level niche differentiation, both of which make coexistence more difficult. In addition, individual variation can exacerbate the effects of demographic stochasticity, and this further destabilises coexistence. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for emerging empirical interests in the effects of intraspecific variation on species diversity.},

	abstract = {Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area ({LMA}) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of {LMA} will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems. We present an approach to explaining {LMA} from the numbers, dimensions and mass densities of leaf cells and tissues, which provided unprecedented explanatory power for 11 broadleaved woody angiosperm species diverse in {LMA} (33–262 g m−2; R2 = 0.94; P {\textless} 0.001). Across these diverse species, and in a larger comparison of evergreen vs. deciduous angiosperms, high {LMA} resulted principally from larger cell sizes, greater major vein allocation, greater numbers of mesophyll cell layers and higher cell mass densities. This explicit approach enables relating leaf anatomy and composition to a wide range of processes in physiological, evolutionary, community and macroecology.},

	abstract = {Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth simulator, {TROLL}, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction, and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500 years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g., leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. {TROLL} should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.},
