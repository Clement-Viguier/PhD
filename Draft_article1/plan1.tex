\section{Introduction}

Global change has been subject of a large, and still growing, number of studies. Yet, because the complexitiy of ecological system coupled with the uncertainty around the future of climate and management, a lot of work is remaining to predict the state of natural and semi-natural systems in the future. Vegetation communities are of particular interest as they provide both economic value and ecosystem services. If a large part of plant community ecology is foccused on forests, the presumed vulnerability to global change of mountain grasslands has led scientists to study them. If their actual vulnerability is still discussed (phd of sandra, ecoveg 2015), mountain grasslands will certainly be exposed to increasing temperature and droughts, but also to changes in management practices with a reduction of grazing (ask greg, see ref in ceres baros first paper).\\
To better understand and predict the effect of global change in these ecosystems of mountain grasslands, empiricall studies and experiments have been set. (see Jena, leca and Levine). These studies and others (Violle, albert, jung) highlight the importance of intra-specific variations in community ecology. Intra-specific variations represent around 20 and 30 percent of total variation in grasslands (see albert) and could greatly alter the species interactions and community response to abiotic factors. Considering intra-specific variations is important to better understand community dynamics (violle) and in models because they favour coexistence (Clark, Jung, Courbaud) and modify community responses (Jung). Such effects are succeptible to greatly influence the dynamic of communities facing global change by mitigating species level response, soften plant niches frontier, altering species competition. Another argument is the fact that intra-specific changes may alter directly the community response to a stress (Jung).\\

 Moreover the role of long term evolutionary and ecological processes cannot be easilly assessed in such designs. Moreover, considering the multiplicity of climatic and management scenarios scales up the work to a limiting point.\\



To overcome these limitations and difficulties, modelling approaches has been developped (fate-h, samsara, taubert, lohier ...). They are either used for the retrospective studies long term dynamics from time series data, the prediction of community dynamics along different scenarios, or to interogate the underlying mecanisms of community dynamics (gemini). These models, to be able to account for changing condittions are all based on strong plant functioning processes at the scale of interest and are supported by field data through parametrisation.\\


Most of these models feature a fixed plant functioning where the dynamic of the community is mostly driven by, 1) the abiotic conditions, 2) the relative competitiveness of species/group specific parameters or direct competion coefficients. If 1) is essential in the context of climate change, the point 2) as main mechanism of plant interaction can be discussed as it relies on differences between species specific physiological parameters. Physiological or competition parameters are generally estimated by direct measures or derived from dta through calibration. Both methods give estimators in what we have good confidence, however they do not allow them to vary within the group (plant functional type, species or population) they have been defined for. The estimator produce good results and generally follow fundamental or ecological trade-offs. Yet, they do not allow for variations within the group for these parameters, as they are not strictly constraint by said trade-offs and could lead to Darwinian demons, or would require calibration of this variation space. More efforts must be done in the representation of the link  between chemical, anatomical and morphological traits and physiological traits that drive plant growth and plant interactions. Defining such link would authorise variations within a group while maintaining strong trade-offs between physiological traits and allowing variation and search in the strategy space... (not clear).\\

We stressed the importance of considering intra-specific variations, ann highlight the necessity for a link between chemical and anatomical traits to functioning traits.  
 Not clear what is genetic variation and selection/evolutionary processes or phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity in models: theoretical: 2 species interactions, not at community model. (Heritability ?)




There is a need for community models capable of reproducing diverse plant communities. To investigate the effect of climate change it has to incorporate mechanism of response and individual level.\\
Such mechanism is called phenotypic plasticity\\

\textbf{
How is it really different from source-sink approaches ? Or functional equilibrium ?}
-> allocation based, trait variations, plasticity is a strategy. This last poinnt is important. It's related to the discussion around van kleunen ad Dewitt (not all species are plastic, sultan says most are) <- check that.\\

The need of mechanistic model integrating functional traits and carbon allocation ... \cite{marechaux_individual-based_2017} + probably general reviews on vegetation modelling

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Model overview and concepts}
\paragraph{Overview of \textit{MountGrass}}
\paragraph{Plasticity in \textit{MountGrass}:
 concepts and implementation}

\textbf{Allocation} Why allocation and not just traits ? Allocation model provide structural constraint for plant strategies. Study ecology is studying the relative performance of individuals (and their impact on environmental conditions) in relationship with their strategies. Considering the amount of traits and strategies plants can develop, it is crucial to reduce the dimensionality of the strategic space (space define by all independent strategic axis plant can be found on). The most effective way to use laws of physics, chemistry and biology to eliminate impossible strategies (or combination of traits). Allocation based model take advantage of the "law of mass balance" ... to limit the number of possible allocation pattern, or strategies. This approach has the advantage of creating limited \textit{continuous} strategy space that can be explored and reveal ecological relationships/constraint. The search for such relationships or trade-offs is a big challenge in empirical ecology (see \cite{reich_evolution_2003, wright_worldwide_2004, diaz_plant_2004, diaz_global_2016} for plants) and ecological modelling (see \cite{reineking_environmental_2006, falster_plant:_2016}) as they reduce the complexity and help understand the main mechanisms that shape communities.\\
Introduce the idea of default strategy with this ratio of active vs structural tissues.


\textbf{Plasticity}: expected environment -> phenotype, here phneotype is equivalent to biomass partitioning, that means expected environement -> allocation coefficients. Then memory -> expectations -> allocation. Because low dimensions, and we want diversity, and the link between memory and allocation might not be a function (one memroy give exactly one optimum allocation), in the model this relationship is not verified. Species specfic traits are used to allow for different strategies to be associated to a same memory (different plants won't have the same strat, despite sharing the projection)\\
Once the plasticity is introduced, talk about the memory. Now you can also talk about the mapping/consistency between both and the difficulties to use both.

\textbf{Allocation algorithms}


\subsection{Calibration}
\paragraph{Pot data}
Pot data consists in total biomass and root shoot ration (RSR) data of ... species grown in pots by Peterson and al. (peterson). This old dataset has the advantages of being grass species grown in a described steady environment with two conditions of watering with measures of essential components of growth: biomass and RSR. The inputs used to simulated these experriment are detailed in appendix.

\paragraph{Individual calibration process}
Bayessian calibration could not be used for the model considering the number of parameters and the simulation time. A filtering process has been implemented in R. Parameters are sampled following the LHS method (from \texttt{lhs} package)	within parameter ranges (desccribed in table ...) defined from the litterature, and constraints dicted by desired behaviours from the model. When necessary the sample is log transformed. Because of strong relationship between exchange rate parameters and cost of exchagne area, exchanges rates parameters are expressed on a mass basis for sampling then transform to an area basis for the model. Phtosynthetic activity is defined relatively to the water uptake activity and water use efficiency (WUE) to avoid extreme root shoot ratios.\\

Once generated a first filtering is applied to save simulation time and avoid unrealistic trait values (see table for ranges extracted from LES data in alpine biome) that are not tested against calibartion data.\\
Once the parameters transformed and filtered, simulations matching growth conditions in Peterson experiments.\\
Generated data from finished simulations (i.e. plant lives until the end and do not exceed model's internal size limits) are then compared to experiment data species by species. Parameters of logistic distribution are computed from species means and standards deviantions for RSR and total biomass. The use of this distribution form is justified by the intrinsic form of RSR measure and the need to reject negative values for total biomass. A parameter set is accepted for one species if it within a 95\% range of the calculated distribution for both RSR and total biomass in wet and dry conditions.\\

\paragraph{Strategy diversity filtering}
To further reduce the number of parameter sets considered, we proceeded in an additional filtering step. Because the first filtering was conduced for only one strategy over the whole 4D strategy space (l\_ini,  w\_ini, as\_s\_d, as\_r\_d) it is necessary to verify that other strategies do not lead to potential Darwinian demon. This should be limited by the choice of priors, while at the same time promoted by the selection of parameters increasing growth to counter balance potential unfitted strategies\footnote{Better do that beforehand than after... But I guess it's too late now.}.

\subsection{Single plant growth simulations}
\paragraph{Simulation set-up}
Individual plant growth is simulated in square pots (9 x 9 x 12) with a soil critical and saturation water content equal to respectively $0.1$ and $0.7 cm^{3}.cm^{-3}$ for 100 days of 15 ours with a spatial resolution of 1 centimetre. Reproduction was enabled and geometric trait fixed for all plants.

\paragraph{Landscape performance simulations}
$15^{3}$ uniformly distributed phenotypes were sampled in the space defined by the proportion of active tissues in shoot and in root and the proportion of root biomass in the whole plant. Each phenotype's growth was simulated in two different conditions: high resource availability (1800 Watt per square meter and per day, and 4 mm per day for 100 days of 15 hours) in the same order than the calibration runs, and low resource (four times less resources but same season and day durations). The simulations were run with the fixed phenotype algorithm and the fixed-equilibrium algorithm.

\paragraph{Constant water influx}
The relationship between the optimum root tissue allocation strategy (or resource use strategy) was explore through a set of simulation with different water influx, other conditions being constant. Along this gradient, the growth of a total of 400 different root phenotypes (allocation to active tissues and water availability memory) was simulated. The shoot phenotype was fixed and numerically selected to be closed to the optimum and the light availability was set at maximum.\\
The state of the plant was recorded at the end of the simulation, no taking into account possible production peak during the simulation.\\
Each group of 400 phenotypes where grown with and without phenotypic plasticity (root:shoot plasticity only) for ten different water influx uniformly distributed between 0.05 and 4 mm per days.


\paragraph{Variable water influx}


\section{Results}
\subsection{Growth of diverse species}
\paragraph{Individual calibration}. Calibration filtering results in the selection of n parameter sets over m preselected parameters sets. Accepted sets are distributed among the 11 species of the dataset like presented in the table. Species A, B and C are the most numerous.\\
sensitivity analysis. The models about seems to be sensitive to the following parameters: $r_1$, $\beta_0$, $P_{max}$, $u_{max}$, $k_{or}$, $\rho_{ar}$. The four first parameters are related to global resource availability and directly related to growth rate, while the second and the last three and related to the below-ground resource foraging and exchange rate.\\
Total biomass is particularly sensitive to exchange rate parameters, but also tissue construction cost. (not shown)\\

Plasticity does not change the acceptance rate in any form (only slight increased from 0.26\% to 0.38\%). Despite non overlapping (around respectively and third and a quarter of accepted parameter sets are shared between non plastic and plastic calibration) the distribution of not shared parameter sets are very similar and does not show any clear pattern. \\

accept = f(tau)\\

PCA reveal that sensitive parameters are also the dominant variables in the main components of the component analysis of the accepted parameter sets. Species cannot be distinguished on the two main component space, neither on 1 or 2D species specific parameters space (l\_ini, w\_ini, w\_ini vs l\_ini, as\_s\_d, as\_r\_d, as\_r\_d vs as\_s\_d) despite small variations in distribution shapes between species.\\

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Individual growth pattern and plasticity}

Individual growth and allocation looks like that:\\
change in size of different pools (shoot, active, shoot str, stem ..., rep, storage). Plus constant traits.\\

Different allocation algorithms change the growth but also the traits:\\
BMtot, RSR, SRL and SLA of the same plant with different algorithms, other things being equal.

\caption{Performance landscape.}
Landscape accessible with only RSR plasticity. Part of the landscape (especailly) optimum is not accessible without trait plasticity.
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Active versus structural: the foundation of the niche}

Niche results from the absolute (potential niche) or relative (realised niche) performance of individual plant along environmental gradient. Performance (if measured as living biomass at a given time) in \model is a composite variable depending on: the absolute efficiency of the different organs (shoot and root), the relative proportion of these organs, and the equilibrium between shoot and root activity.\\
Theoretical performance trade-off: result from the mathematical expression of construction cost of tissue and their exchange rates.\\

Freer allocation algorithms lead to convergence to phenotypes of higher performance. But these phenotype may also be of higher risk ! $\rightarrow $ need for good condition estimation.\\

\subsection{Community level}

Coexisting species ? (look at seed bank to see the traits of coexisting (and persistent) species)
How does plasticity may affect that ?


\section{Discussion}
We build a model of plant growth based on allocation trade-off at the organ level that we compare to empirical data to validate the behaviour of the model. This model was used to explore the how strategy impact fitness along a resource gradient and how this is altered by plasticity.
 
\subsection{Allocation trade-off}
- fundamental and theoretical support to the approach, plus it works with plasticity\\
- different strats are working in low conditions\\
- higher stability of more conservative strats.\\
- flexible multidimension strategy space: better diversity if diverse regulation factors, multiple dimension of variability (resources anddisturbance). Can be used to explore ecolgical trade-off in a space that is constraint.

\subsection{Plasticity effect}
- improve performance (expected)\\
- allows for more exploitative strategies\\
- increase the competitive effect of exploitative species (despite higher relative improvment at margins)\\
- question of efficiency
- widen the absolute niche (improvement of bad performers) but narrow the relative niche

\subsection{Going further with plasticity}
- new estimates
- trait changes
- how the more exploitative species (supposedly less resistant to drought) would resist to drought event ?
- selection for plasticity along cons-exploit gradient ?

\section{Conclusion}
allocation trade-off are good. plasticity benefit is asymmetric: more perf and balance in efficiency

%\paragraph{Individual calibration}
%The validation of multiple parameter sets during the individual-growth parameter filtering process demonstrates the capacity of the model to reproduce growth of alpine plant in two different set of conditions. Howevern the high sensitivity of parameters involved in water uptake ($\beta_0$, $u_{max}$, $k_{or}$, $\rho_{ar}$) and whole plant productivity ($r_1$, $P_{max}$) and the selection of parameters values (for these parameters and less sensitive parameters) indicates that maintening growth might be more difficult than expected. This could be explained by
