The chapter contains the main results of simulation experiments at the individual scale. It provides insights on the impact of the plastic allocation algorithms on individual growth patterns and potential effects on community properties. 

The first part is dedicated to the parameter filtering and the study on individual growth in a stable environment. The second part examines responses of individual root strategies to two gradients of water availability: (1) with constant influx but differences in mean influx to simulate spatial heterogeneity, (2) with a shared mean influx, but contrasting rates of reduction of precipitation to simulate the reduction of the available resource during the growing season.

\chapter{Model properties and individual responses}
%%(Related to the notions cited above, like performance decomposition)
%Question I try to answer: (use of schematics ?)

%The modelling framework developed in the previous chapter offers multiple options to explore the effect of phenotypic plasticity on plant growth and later plant community dynamics. Before investigating the effects of such mechanisms on complex systems dynamics, it is important to have a deep understanding of the model behaviour at the individual level. As explained in the introduction, the relationship between resources and individual plant growth is the base for plant interactions, abiotic filtering and coexistence mechanisms.
%This chapter of the document focuses on the calibration and exploration of the model for isolated individuals. The results of the simulation experiments exploring diverse aspects of resource-plant growth relationship will be interpreted at individual scales, but I will also attempt to extend conclusion to higher level mechanisms.

The first part of the chapter is dedicated to the parameter filtering process, the sensitivity analysis and basic model behaviour. %Then follows the exploration of plant performance as a function of plant strategy and resources levels and dynamics.

\section{Parametrisation and sensitivity analysis} \label{section:calibration}

Calibration, or \textemph{parametrisation}, is an essential step in the development of an agent-based model. ABMs are often characterised by multiple processes, and thus parameters, at individual levels. The results of these processes (depending on parameter values) from numerous individuals combine to produce the group or community behaviour. Because there are interactions between the processes and between the agents, the overall behaviour of the group (often the subject of interest) is sensitive to these parameters. For the same reasons, an incredible variety of results could be produced with ABMs if the parameters were not chosen in order to produce sensible responses to simulated conditions. The aim of the calibration is to determine the best values for the model parameters, from the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the processes and parameters, and the comparison with data. This step often goes along with a sensitivity analysis that determines the relative sensitivity of variables of interest to specific parameters.

Because of their nature, ABMs often model processes for which the parameters are either unknown or hard to access, because they are at the individual scale. In such cases, advance calibration techniques like pattern oriented modelling \parencite{grimm_pattern-oriented_2005, hartig_statistical_2011} can be developed. However, such method requires a high number of simulations and relatively precise simulation parameters. Because the implementation in R makes the model relatively slow, and because available datasets, despite being very interesting lack information on sensitive parameters, a less robust but less expensive approach is chosen: \textemph{parameter filtering} at the individual scale. The focus of the part of this work on the individual growth and the will for more individual-centric approach also support this choice.

 For similar reasons of computational cost, the \textemph{sensitivity analysis} is  realised \textit{a posteriori} on calibration runs.

\subsection{Method}

\paragraph{Pot data}
Pot data consists in total biomass and root:shoot ration (RSR) data of 11 species grown in pots by Peterson and Billings \parencite{peterson_growth_1982}. This dataset has the advantages of being grass species grown in a described steady environment with two conditions of watering with measures of essential components of growth: biomass and RSR.

\paragraph{Pot simulation}
Simulated plants grow in square pots 9 cm wide and 12 cm deep. The soil is characterised by the following parameters: critical soil water content: $0.1 m^3.m^{-3}$, and saturation water content: $0.1 m^3.m^{-3}$. The simulation time of 111 days of 15 hours is divided between the growing phase of 48 days and the treatment phase when plants are watered (soil saturation), either once a week or once a day. The light level and water influx are simulated following the experimental conditions \parencite{peterson_growth_1982} by a lighting of 1850 Watts per square meter, and soil saturation. Plants have default geometry parameters,  reproduction is ignored and it is assumed that plants do not stop their growth.

\paragraph{Parameter filtering process}
The whole filtering process has been implemented in \texttt{R}. Model parameters are sampled following the LHS method (from \texttt{lhs} package) within parameter ranges (described in table \ref{table:boundaries}) defined both thanks to the literature and constraints dictated by desired behaviours from the model. When necessary the sample is log transformed. Because of the strong relationship between exchange rate parameters and cost of exchange area, exchanges rates parameters are expressed on a mass basis for sampling then transformed into an area basis for the model. To avoid extreme RSR ratios, the ratio between the mass-based exchange rate parameters is limited between 0.1 and 10.

As explained in the previous chapter, species-specific parameters are required to model plant growth. These parameters are sampled at the same time that the parameters of the model, according to ranges detailed in table chapter \ref{part:model}, \ref{table:state_var_species}. Once the parameters are generated, a first filtering is applied to save simulation time and avoid unrealistic trait values. The computed initial trait values considered out of range (see table \ref{table:boundaries} for ranges extracted from LES data \parencite{wright_worldwide_2004} in the alpine biome) are excluded, modifying the initial distribution of the parameter values (see figure \ref{fig:accept_rate}). These two steps lead to the creation of a list of $n$ independent parameter sets that are then used for individual pot simulations following \citet{peterson_growth_1982} experiment setup.

The results from the finished simulations (i.e. the plant lives until the end and do not exceed model's internal size limits) are then compared to the experiment data species by species. The parameters of logistic distributions are computed from the species means and standards deviations for RSR and total biomass. The use of this distribution form is justified by the intrinsic form of the RSR variable and the need to reject negative values for total biomass variable. A parameter set is accepted for one species if it lies within a 95\% range of the calculated distribution for both RSR and total biomass in wet and dry conditions.

The parameter filtering procedure is applied on the three main allocation algorithms: \textit{non plastic}, \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and \textit{plastic-optimisation}.

\caption{Comparison of simulated weights with distribution of weights of real alpine species for contrasting conditions.}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Sensitivity analysis}
The relative importance of variables in the selection process is investigated with the packages \texttt{randomForest}. A random forest analysis (depth = 5, number of trees = 300) is performed on a balanced dataset composed of all selected parameter sets and a random sample of rejected sets of equal size. Importance is assessed on the results of the random forest.

\subsection{Results}

\paragraph{Selection rate}
Parameter filtering process resulted in the selection of a low number of parameter sets (below 0.2\%) for each allocation algorithm (table \ref{table:selection_rate}). This number is below the sum of accepted parameter sets per species because a parameter set can match to multiple species. Not all species contribute to the same extent to the filtering process. \textit{Astragalus whitneyi} accounts for a high percentage of accepted parameter sets, while no parameter set could match 2 species (\textit{Oxyria dignya} and \textit{Deschampsia caespitosa}). The former is characterised by wide distribution in both conditions for the two variables of interest (weight and RSR), while the latter shows relatively tight distribution with little overlap between the conditions for both variables (see figure \ref{fig:comparison_BM} for comparison between simulations and data for total weight).

\input{../Resources/Calibration/acc_rate_all.tex}
\vspace*{12pt}
Despite the low selection rate, a difference can be noted between the \textit{fixed-equilibrium} algorithm and the two other algorithms with an accepted rate of 0.14 \% against 0.09\% and 0.10\% (table \ref{table:selection_rate}). This difference cannot be explained by a significantly better selection rate for specific species, but rather by higher rates for all species.

Most of the parameter sets are not shared between the algorithms (\textit{i.e.} around respectively a third and a quarter of accepted parameter sets are shared between \textit{non plastic} allocation and \textit{fixed-equilibrium} allocation calibrations), despite that, the distribution of parameter values that are not shared are very similar and do not show any clear pattern (data not shown).

Out of the 31 parameters, 6 show graphical response of selection rate (see figure \ref{fig:accept_rate}), and only  \texttt{u\_max} and \texttt{P\_max} present a possible optimum different from limit values. The relative importance of the parameters is better explored in sensitivity analysis.



%Calibration filtering results in the selection of n parameter sets over m preselected parameters sets. Accepted sets are distributed among the 11 species of the dataset like presented in the table. Species A, B and C are the most numerous.\\


%Plasticity does not change the acceptance rate in any form (only slightly increased from 0.26\% to 0.38\%, up to 0.42\% for full plastic). \\

%\end{figure}

\paragraph{Sensitivity analysis}


A total of 12 parameters show a relative influence on selection rate for at least one of the algorithm. These parameters are divided between model parameters and species parameters. Species parameters show influence only for the \textit{non plastic} allocation algorithm. Model parameters express relatively similar importance for all three algorithms. The respiration rate of active tissues (\texttt{r\_1}) is the most sensitive parameters (see figures \ref{fig:accept_rate} and \ref{fig:importance}). Other sensitive parameters are related to water availability (\texttt{beta\_0}), organ exchange rates (\texttt{P\_max} and \texttt{u\_max}) and soil coverage by roots (\texttt{rho\_ ar} and \texttt{k\_or}).

  \label{fg:PCA_calibration}
  }
\end{figure}

The PCA performed for \textit{non plastic} algorithm only on parameter values reveals that the important parameters are also the dominant variables that shape the selected subspace. The two first axis explain only 14\% of the variance. The first one is related to the root activity and efficiency (\texttt{u\_max}, \texttt{l\_ini}, \texttt{rho\_ar} and \texttt{s\_r}), the second is in line with global efficiency and resource availability.

The parameter filtering process is based on individual species, thus differences in the distribution of the accepted parameter sets are expected. Species can be distinguished neither on these two main component space, or on the species specific parameter space (\texttt{l\_ini}, \texttt{w\_ini}, \texttt{w\_ini} \& \texttt{l\_ini}, \texttt{as\_s\_d}, \texttt{as\_r\_d}, \texttt{as\_r\_d} \& \texttt{as\_s\_d}) despite small variations in distribution shapes and ranges between species (data not shown).\\

\paragraph{Variable responses}
% Response of the two main vairables to main parameters.
For each algorithm the response of the two filtering variables (weight and RSR) is plotted against the most important variables in figures \ref{fig:sensitivity_BM} and \ref{fig:sensitivity_RSR}.

% Biomass
The total biomass is particularly sensitive to the tissue respiration cost (\texttt{r\_1)}, but also to the maximum exchange rate parameters. There is a notable difference in growth maxima between the two conditions in favour of the wet condition, in line with observed data. This difference is observed for the three algorithms that differ mainly by the amplitude of the biomass ranges (need data). Growth response curves are similar for all allocation algorithm. Growth is only weakly related to species-specific parameters. Total biomass under \textit{Plastic-optimisation} algorithm seems to be more sensitive to variables influencing the exchange area per unit of biomass.

The species-specific parameter \texttt{tau} controlling the balance between genetic and environmental control does not emerge as an influencing parameter at the global scale for any of the two flexible allocation rules.

Not all parameter set are represented as the y axis is limited around the smooth function (local regression). Coloured points represent selected parameter sets in the two treatments (\textcolor{myOrange}{dry} and \textcolor{myGreen}{wet}).}
\end{figure}

% RSR
Root:Shoot Ratio (or RMF in figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_RSR}) strongly responds to species-specific parameters under \textit{non plastic} allocation because the memory parameters (\texttt{l\_ini} and \texttt{w\_ini}) are the means plants control their RSR. For other allocation rules, species-specific parameters have little control over RSR. Surprisingly, the photosynthetic capacity has a stronger influence on the ratio than the root maximum exchange rate.

\end{figure}

% TAU

\paragraph{Root shoot ratio and plasticity}

Little to no difference in RSR is expected for \textit{non plastic} allocation rule since allocation promoted a fixed phenotype, but both \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation rules allow for changes in RSR. Nevertheless, no stable change in RSR is observed in any of the simulations. Fluctuations are present but consist in stable oscillations between two fixed values (see figure \ref{fig:comparison_RSR}), synchronized with water variations. These rapid adaptations of the relative proportion of roots denote a high flexibility of plant phenotypes in \model.

\subsection{Discussion}

\paragraph{Growth and strategy space}

The relative low selection rates for all allocation rules highlight the complexity of fitting such complex model to empirical data, despite the relative simplicity of the data. This difficulty seems to lie in two factors: the high number of parameters and the lack of stable changes in RSR. This last point is further discussed in the following paragraphs. Nevertheless, plant growth is reproduced in two contrasting conditions for multiple species. While plastic algorithms have a greater potential for growth (higher growth rate), this is not systematic and the absence of clear pattern for the most influencing parameters, such as maximum exchange rates and respiration rates, indicates that such high growth depends on a combination of parameter values. I believe that the shape of gain and cost functions along the functional trade-off between active and structural tissues plays a determining role in the growth. A trade-off function with a wider viable range is more likely to be selected as more strategies would grow (therefore reducing the relative sensitivity to species-specific parameters). Considering the exponential shape of the turn-over function (one of the main cost with respiration), the width and height of the trade-off (or net gain function) is probably more strongly linked to the gain functions (exchange rates) and linear cost function (respiration), explaining little effect of parameters related to lifespan (already preselected otherwise). There is a strong dependency between viable strategies (and as a consequence of functional potential diversity) and the main trade-off between resource acquisition and efficiency.

Filtering the parameter sets based on all species instead of individually would have been ideal to quantify this link and better calibrate the model. However, such approach would have required many more simulations, when the parameter filtering method was chosen for its low computational cost. Moreover, considering the number of species-specific parameters, fitting the strategy subspace (at least default active tissue allocation parameters, the memory of resources and stability) of 11 species to the data in combination with more than 20 models parameters is near impossible. Ones should have had first determined the relative positions of the species within the said strategy space before any global calibration routine. Nonetheless, species-specific parameters have an influence on model main variables. The memory parameter affected the RSR in the context of \textit{non plastic} allocation rule (see figures \ref{fig:comparison_RSR} and \ref{fig:importance}), while the default proportion of active tissues in roots was an influencing parameter in all algorithms (figure \ref{fig:importance}, \texttt{as\_r\_d}). Therefore, they should be analysed in further simulations within the same set of model parameters.

Because of the model complexity and the number of species-specific parameters, in addition to long simulation time, Bayesian calibration could not be performed. In the Bayesian paradigm, the information is contained in the data and revealed by the structure of the model. An alternative modelling approach is to use the parametrisation phase to accept certain parameter sets, and learn about the system through simulation experiments. The simulated data is analysed rather than empirical data. The patterns emerging from the simulation experiments inform us of the impact of the modelled mechanisms (even if they do not totally match the data). Therefore the model is still an understanding tool and can inform about the effect of plasticity on ecological processes.\\


\textbf{The growth is reproduced in contrasted conditions, but only partially as one species per parameter set is tested. The number of species and dimensions in the strategy space would not allow for a calibration of all species for one parameter set. The plastic response of the root:shoot ratio is not correctly reproduced and would require a different implementation (stress based). However, the plasticity as implemented improved the acceptance rate because of a better growth. Therefore the effects of plasticity can still be investigated with simulation experiments.}

\paragraph{The role of water}

If the parameter filtering step does not result in the selection of optimum values for all parameters, it provides information on the main mechanisms influence plant growth. Indeed, the relatively high importance of parameters related to water shows the importance of the resource on the model behaviour. Both water availability (water absorption limitation, exchange rate) and root mass and construction parameters are important to match the empirical data. Considering that the calibration relies on experimental data of drought events, it is no surprise that parameters related to water economy show a strong influence on the selection rate and model behaviour. In the context where the model has been developed, water shortage is expected to be an important factor for the community dynamics. In this perspective, the ability of \model to reproduce the differences in productivity between both conditions, and the relative sensitivity to water-related parameters is an advantage. The link between water resource, species strategy, plant performance and phenotypic plasticity is explored more in details in the following section.\\


%Differences between algorithms that make sense: more biomass, sensitive parameters are related to how plasticity work...

\textbf{The sensitivity of the different variables to the parameters align with the two criteria of selection (that work with the independence of trade-off). In contrast with forest, the light is not the most important factor and water plays a more limiting role. A particular focus on below-ground resources should drive the simulation experiments with this model.}

%\paragraph{More complex plasticity?}

\paragraph{Phenotype flexibility}

As mentioned earlier in this discussion, the model is not able to produce any shift in RSR in different water treatment. It is not a surprise for \textit{non plastic} algorithm, but the filter was still applied on this criterion to allow the comparison with the plastic algorithm and to be able to measure the improvement in selection rate. However, even plastic algorithms do not show strong enough response to water treatment in term of RSR. A strong and good (in the sense it would have matched the data) is larger in amplitude and more stable in time. Such processes generally amplify with time, \textit{i.e.} when the number of drought event increases, the response (allocation to roots) increases (relative to default phenotype). Unlike natural systems, plants in \model fluctuate between two 'states', or phenotypes associated with the dry and the wet conditions. The value of the RSR following a drought event is reached after the first week without water. This can be explained by two main mechanisms that are related but have contrasting implications. The quickness in response to the changing conditions is allowed by relatively high assimilation rates. While the net growth rate is limited by the comparison during the filtering process of the total weight of plants with the empirical data, the assimilation rate is not and can be compensated with a relatively high turn-over rate. Net growth rate being equal, species with higher assimilation rate will have higher \textemph{phenotypic flexibility} (higher fraction of biomass to invest in carbon pool of choice) than species with lower assimilation rate (but lower turn-over). This flexibility, similar to reallocation, allows changes in RSR, but not the accumulation of biomass in roots. Unfortunately, both the constant turn-over rate implemented in the model and the selection toward 'wide and high' gain functions limit control on this aspect.

This generalised high phenotypic flexibility, allowed by high assimilation rates to compensate high turn-over rates, highlights a problem within the calibration. The reproduction of growth patterns gives us confidence in the good functioning parameter filtering process, so wrong priors are certainly the cause of this behaviour. The uncertainty around the exchange rates for shoot and roots lead to the definition of relatively wide priors informed by parametrised models \parencite{kleidon_global_2000, reineking_environmental_2006, taubert_modelling_2014}. In the other hand, the turn-over parameters are relatively well informed by modelling approaches but also empirical studies \parencite{ ryser_ecological_2000, wright_worldwide_2004, tjoelker_linking_2005,  luke_mccormack_predicting_2012}, leading to more constrained priors. The value of these priors is not discussed, it is rather how they are translated within the context of the model leading to an over-estimation of the cost of leaf senescence. Because the lifespan is integrated at the daily time-step as a constant turn-over rate, instead of a late decrease in biomass as in natural systems, the biomass is reduced early in the growth (from day 0). This can be a problem when the growth is non-linear, especially when growth is higher early in the growth period. In this context, fairly narrow priors can lead to an over-estimation of the turn-over cost as the non-linear growth is not properly integrated by the integration of the tissue senescence. This over-estimation is then compensated, during the parameter filtering process by a higher assimilation rate and a higher tissue flexibility.

The particular design of the experiment from \citet{peterson_growth_1982} with cycling wet and drought periods can also explain this effect. Other experiment designs with shifts in the mean influx of water would limit the role of the phenotypic flexibility and show more consistent differences in RSR between wet and dry conditions.
% is not the priors value that is discussed, but how it is translated in the model, and how in combination with relatively narrow priors, limit the emergence of stable RSR differences due to inertia.


Moreover, the fact that plants are more productive during periods where they may not want to invest in roots reduces the possibility for a strong durable shift of RSR. Indeed, a plant would drift to higher RSR if it was more productive when pursuing the high RSR phenotype than when pursuing the low RSR phenotype. This last point mentions the 'will' of the plant, in the context of \model this target-phenotype is encoded in the projection of external conditions. Because this projection is daily based on design, the accumulation of drought stress is not translated in the internal projection variables of the plant (like it can be with the accumulation of phytohormones.). This limitation highlights a big difference between simulated plants in \model and natural plants. While solutions to overcome this problem can easily be imagined (see equation \ref{eq:projection_alt} in \ref{subsection:submodels}), they would require more parameters and introduce more complexity to the analysis. This model provides a first approach to phenotypic plasticity in grassland models and the formulation of the projection, key element of the phenotypic plasticity, is certainly a starting point for further development. Nevertheless, the differences in response to the parameters between the three allocation rules, despite shared plant functioning, demonstrate the importance of plasticity itself. And simplification of the processes should not be a reason to not explore its effects. The fact that the parameter \texttt{tau} has a relatively small impact on selection rates also support the need to better understand all strategic axis before focusing on the effect of projection. While there are many ways of simulating the phenotypic plasticity, the parsimony is privileged. This simple representation is enough to understand the effects of active plastic allocation in association with the other strategic differences between species.\\

\textbf{The high flexibility of the plant phenotype given by the high assimilation and turn-over rates reduces the inertia of the model and its capacity for modelling lasting changes in RSR. The modelling of the plastic response also reduces the capacity of the model to well capture changes in RSR. }\\

\textbf{The parameter filtering process successfully captures the growth pattern, showing convincing patterns of parameter sensitivity and variable response. However, limitations in the plastic response modelling, coupled with high phenotypic flexibility and a particular experiment-design do not allow a solid representation of the RSR differences between the conditions.

\section{Individual level behaviour and properties of plastic allocation algorithm driven by the plant memory}


Calibration and sensitivity analysis gives information on the main processes of plant growth, but the general effects of the allocation rules on plant growth are not fully identified. Moreover, because the parameter filtering processes were limited to individual plants and the effects of the species-specific parameters are depending on the other parameters of the model, the effects of these species-specific parameters should further be investigated. The objective of this part is to set better understanding of the role of the \textemph{allocation rules} and species \textemph{memory} on plant development as the basis for interpretation of plasticity effects in following chapters.

The challenge of the framework presented in the paragraph \ref{subsection:memory} under \textit{plastic-optimisation} is to control the phenotype with the values of the memory. The risk of this approach is to have too tight estimation function of the fitness (or driving function) and to see the convergence of all species (with different memory values) toward the same phenotype (same allocation of active and structural tissues in roots and shoot). The extent to which different species memory lead to different phenotypes under full genetic control (not influenced by the external conditions) is explored through simulation experiment under \textit{plastic optimisation} allocation algorithm with no effect of conditions on traits ($\tau = 1$), only on growth.

%Proof of concept
\subsection{Method}


%\paragraph{Strategy diversity filtering}
%To further reduce the number of parameter sets considered, we proceeded in an additional filtering step. Because the first filtering was conducted for only one strategy over the whole 4D strategy space (l\_ini,  w\_ini, as\_s\_d, as\_r\_d) it is necessary to verify that other strategies do not lead to a potential Darwinian demon. This should be limited by the choice of priors, while at the same time promoted by the selection of parameters increasing growth to counterbalance potential unfitted strategies\footnote{Better do that beforehand than after... But I guess it's too late now.}.

\paragraph{Allocation algorithms}
The effect of allocation rule on phenotypic development is investigated thanks to pot simulations (see Methods in \ref{section:calibration}) of 100 days in 3 watering treatment: 2mm, 8mm and 16mm per day. To avoid drift in the phenotype due to allocation algorithm (see paragraph \ref{subsection:memory} on phenotypic determination), simulations were run a first time, then rerun with default specific traits matching traits at the end of the first simulation set. All four algorithms are simulated. To reduce the number of simulations 100 parameter sets are selected randomly within the accepted parameter sets for the \textit{non plastic algorithm}.

\paragraph{Memory \& phenotype}
The memory of external conditions plays a determining role in phenotypic development under \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation rules. The effect of the memory alone (environmental cues ignored by setting \texttt{tau} to 1) on the default emerging phenotype is explored for diverse memories (9 values on the two axis from 0.1 to 1 later scaled to the maximum area exchange rates for model parameter set considered, or 81 values) for each accepted parameter set. The effect of the memory values on the final position of plants in the phenotypic space is visualised by fitting loess curves between memory values and individual trait values.

\subsection{Results}

\paragraph{Allocation algorithms}

The fraction of organic matter allocated to the stem (ensemble of supporting tissues for shoot and roots) are increasing over time for all algorithms. The \textit{non plastic} algorithm show constant allocation coefficients between above-ground and below-ground compartments and between active and structural tissues. All others show different coefficients for the above-ground - below-ground partitioning, and the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm have changing proportion of active and structural tissues. The bottom-right panel shows the total biomass for the four allocation algorithms after 100 days. }
\end{figure}


%think of a "showtime" visualisation that shows how growth and traits are impacted by allocation rules and \texttt{tau}.\\

The allocation algorithm affects the way the organic matter is distributed between the different tissues of the plant. With partitioning coefficient pre-established for the given conditions, the algorithm shows very similar performances (see figure \ref{fig:allocation}). The difference in allocation algorithm is mostly noticeable in figure \ref{fig:allocation} mostly on the shift toward root allocation at the end of the simulation when the water starts to be limiting. The plant under \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation benefit from a slight improvement in performance (mean: +10\%, median: +3.4\% relative to \textit{non plastic}).

The \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm allows changes in the proportion of active tissues in organs. This may have repercussions on the allocation between shoot and root but also can lead to non-specific variability within plants with no perception of resource fluctuations ($tau = 1$). The median variability of the RMF (root mass fraction) along the 100 simulated days is 0.015, that is five times higher than the variability of the other plastic algorithms (\textit{fixed-optimisation} and \textit{fixed-equilibrium})(see table \ref{table:variability-rmf}). This variability is much higher (around 0.028) for the plastic plants in all three plastic algorithms, while it is null for the \textit{non plastic} allocation rule. The range of the RMF follows a similar trend, with a higher value for the \textit{plasti-optimisation} than the other algorithms when plants do not perceive the resource fluctuations, and wide range for all plastic allocation algorithms when plants take into account the changes in light and water resources.

\end{table}

The plastic algorithms show similar levels of variation and range, while the \textit{non plastic} one is stable as expected. The \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation show more instability for non plastic plants ($tau = 1$) but that is lower than the variability observed in plastic plants ($tau = 0$). The allocation (and therefore phenotype) is controlled by the allocation rules (plastic dimensions and objective functions) and the estimation of conditions. Before investigating the effects of varying conditions, it is important to understand the effect of memory on plant strategy and phenotype.

\caption{Trajectories along time in the strategy space of 5 plants with different memories. After 10 days, all plants have converged toward the estimated optimum.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Memory and phenotype}

The kinetics of the phenotypic shift is first visualised for one parameter set on the two main phenotypic axes (proportion of active tissues in roots: PAR and proportion of active tissues in the shoot: PAS). From the same starting point, the five species show a distinct rapid shift toward segregated subspaces of the 2D strategy space. The equilibrium point is reached in approximately 10 days for all 5 species. Despite constant memory, variations are visible on both tissue allocation traits of roots and shoot. These variations lead to partial overlap but the five species are distinct on the 2D space.

The memory of resource availability is a strong enough driver to alter the default phenotype of a species. The effect of the two components of the memory (memory of water availability and memory of light availability) on the three main traits is explored through local regressions. The proportion of active tissues in roots increases to a plateau with the increase in water availability memory (figure \ref{fig:w_ini_p_as_r}). This response pattern is consistent between all parameter sets, but the starting points and slopes may differ. The same pattern is observed between light availability memory and proportion of active tissues in roots (data not shown). The allocation convergence in the root is also influenced by the increase in light availability memory. An increase in the latter leads to a smooth increase in the former (see figure \ref{fig:l_ini_p_as_r}) with less drastic response than the water. This response is mirrored in shoot allocation response to increase in water availability memory (data not shown). Both organs react in symmetric ways to increase in resource availability. The RSR has a negative log response to water availability memory (positive in the case of light availability memory).

\begin{figure}\label{fig:w_ini_p_as_r}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Individual/w_ini_p_as_r.pdf}
\caption{Effect of memory of water availability on proportion of active tissues in roots. \textit{Plastic-optimisation}.

\end{figure}

The combined effect of the two axes of plant resource availability memory is observed by plotting the phenotypes (on the 2D space of active tissue allocation) of four contrasting memories for all parameter sets (figure \ref{fig:memory_n_phenotype}). There is clear clustering of the four memory profiles, with some overlaps due to the fact that multiple parameter sets are plotted at the same time. The memory of low availability (\textcolor{myRed}{$\bullet$}) has a much larger distribution area than others, suggesting the relative instability of this profile within the "estimated net gain landscape". A memory of low availability for both resources drives plant toward very conservative strategies than other strategies. High expected availability of at least one resource increases allocation to active tissues to both organs. This confirms the positive effect of complementary resources (light for roots and water for the shoot) of active tissue allocation in organs (see figure \ref{fig:l_ini_p_as_r}). Because of this, there is no highly unbalance phenotypes with high contrast between organ-specific allocation emerging from the \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation in \model. There is general coordination, but the balance between resource availability memories still impacts the position on the 2D, illustrated by the absence of overlap between low light - high water  (\textcolor{myBlue}{$\bullet$}) and high light - low water (\textcolor{myYellow}{$\bullet$}) phenotypes. In case of high resource availability and coordination, high investment in active tissues for both organ is achieved (\textcolor{myGreen}{$\bullet$}) and high light - high water), but the range of values is similar than for unbalanced memories (\textcolor{myBlue}{$\bullet$}) and high light - low water (\textcolor{myYellow}{$\bullet$}).

\subsection{Discussion}

\paragraph{Allocation algorithms}

The pre-calculation of phenotypes, avoiding any phenotypic drift, allows for all allocation rules to grow plants with close performances. Nevertheless, the plastic algorithms show changes in RMF at the end of the simulation when the light:water balance starts to shift. This consistent shift in RMF for all three plastic allocation rules (with a low variation of the other plastic dimensions) suggests the sensitivity and importance of this phenotypic axis. On the other hand, the other plastic dimensions benefit the plant growth suggesting that they also play a role in the tissue efficiency. While both the RMF and the proportion of active tissues can change the exchange area, only the proportion of active tissues can change the tissue efficiencies. Because the RMF shows similar levels of variation and range in both \textit{fixed} algorithms (RMF is the only plastic dimension) and \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm (see table \ref{table:variability-rmf}) the allocation of active tissue in the latter algorithm does not compensate for change in root:shoot allocation and is not used to increase the area of the limiting organ. This is confirmed by the fact that memory of low-light conditions (\textcolor{myBlue}{$\bullet$} in figure \ref{fig:memory_n_phenotype}) lead to lower allocation to active tissues than high light conditions (\textcolor{myYellow}{$\bullet$}). In the case of fully plastic plants trying to optimise their growth, the vegetative phenotypic dimensions do not fulfil the same functions: the RMF is used to adjust the balance between the resource exchanges while the changes in active tissue proportions are related to the tissue and whole plant efficiency. This contrast in functions looks opposed to what is often observed in empirical studies where shoot:root ratio and SLA (here controlled by the proportion of active tissues) respond in the same direction to increase the leaf area and compensate low incident light \parencite{ryser_consequences_2000, poorter_causes_2009, poorter_biomass_2012}. This discrepancy reveals a limitation within the plastic-allocation algorithm: the balance function is mostly supported by changes in root:shoot ratio while the proportion of active tissues (controlling SLA and SRL) controls the tissues efficiency. The low proportion of active tissues in low resource (\textcolor{myRed}{$\bullet$} in figure \ref{fig:memory_n_phenotype}) indicates a selection of more conservative phenotypes when the resource is scarcer. This is in agreement with the Grime's triangle \parencite{grime_evidence_1977} and large-scale empirical studies \parencite{wright_worldwide_2004}. In contrast with the conclusions of \citet{ryser_consequences_2000}, here the full phenotypic plasticity of the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm is driven by similar constraints than the long-term selection processes. This can be explained by the design of the trade-offs that drive the gain function (see chapter \ref{part:model}). Therefore there are strong constraints on the tissue allocation, but low constraints on the root-shoot allocation. An additional constraint of this dimension can be added by considering other functions of each organ (such as nitrogen absorption by roots), or more artificially by increasing the cost of the displacement along the RMF axis. The fact that traits and allocation may be constrained in different ways has been observed by \citet{freschet_integrated_2015}, highlighting contrasted types of response between shoot and roots \parencite{poorter_limits_2015}. Also, it appears here that studying the long-term effect of a fixed estimation of conditions is probably not the best way to understand how the plastic responses of plants to an abrupt change in conditions. However, in \model, the plasticity is driven by the same mechanism, so such interpretations can be made. But, this discrepancy suggests that mean phenotype and plastic responses should probably not be driven by exactly the same mechanisms.

In addition to this imbalance in constraints, the mean organ approach can also explain this behaviour. Approximating the properties of the canopy by considering one mean organ leads to a low impact of the plastic allocation on the SLA and SRL if the already existing compartments are large relative to the growth, a high importance of old tissues, while most of the exchange activity is generally produced by freshly grown tissues. Also, the rapid growth and turn-over in numerous parameter sets also authorise rapid plastic response on the RMF dimension (see also the rapid oscillations in the figure \ref{fig:comparison_RSR} top left panel), diminishing the need for tissue-specific adjustments. A stronger calibration of gross production and turn-over rates, as mentioned in the previous section, should reduce this effect. Finally, the optimisation function may be too strong and plants may not always go for the optimum allocation but for the fastest and most competitive choice (see \citet{farrior_resource_2011,dybzinski_evolutionarily_2011, farrior_competitive_2014}). If this is not a problem in the context of this simulation where the memory is used to drive the default phenotype of the plant, it would be problematic in the context of plastic responses.\\


\textbf{The different allocation algorithms impact the vegetative phenotype in different ways, but with a similar performance when any phenotypic drift is avoided. But, the plasticity along the three main dimensions of the plant vegetative phenotype (PAR, PAS \& RMF) seems to have different objectives. While the RMF is the main adjustment variable to respond to changes in equilibrium, the proportion of active tissues is more closely related to the amount of resources and tissue efficiency.  However, it does not reproduce increases in organ area by changes in traits when the related resource is limiting. Multiple factors can explain this partial discrepancy with empirical results. The model can still be used to better understand the role of the memory as a driver for the phenotypic development, and the effects of the plasticity (particularly the RMF dimension) on plant performances.}

\paragraph{Strategies and coordination}

The \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation algorithm allows for interesting insights into how the different resources affect the theoretical optimum phenotype. The increase in resource levels leads to an increase in the allocation of organic matter to the active tissues. While this is commonly demonstrated, the indirect effect of one resource on an organ that is not limiting for this resource is less often studied. A higher perceived resource availability drives plants to have a higher proportion of active tissues in both gathering (\textit{i.e.} leaves for an increase in light availability) and other organs (\textit{i.e.} roots for an increase in light availability). The direct effect on the related organ shows a rapid shift from low to a maximum value. This rapid shift can be explained by the fact that the increased resource availability both increases the slope of the exchange rate per biomass (gain function) and reduce the importance of the maintenance costs relative to the productivity, favouring the exploitative strategies.

In the other hand, the indirect effect of an increased resource level on the non-gathering organ can be explained by two mechanisms: a shift in the limiting organ requiring an increase in the exchange area of the newly limiting organ or an increasing gross productivity reducing the need for efficient organs. The former mechanism is related to the equilibrium maintenance. The balance between the two organs can be maintained by increasing the exchange area of the newly limiting organ (or reducing the exchange area of the non-limiting organ, see \citet{liu_biomass_2004} for an example, or \citet{grassein_plant_2010}). However this type of response is unlikely considering this implementation of phenotypic plasticity. The changes in exchange area are mostly driven by the organ biomass rather than its proportion of active tissues (see previous paragraph). The latter mechanism is more in line with the observations of the behaviour of \model (figures \ref{fig:memory_n_phenotype} \& \ref{fig:l_ini_p_as_r}). It explains the increase in active tissues in both organs by an increase in the exchange rate of the gathering organ and in the productivity a the plant scale, decreasing the relative importance of maintenance costs and allowing for a more exploitive strategy of the organs. 

Such allocation pattern could explain coordination between organs, as the cost of the respiration and turn-over are compensated globally by the gross productivity, and allows divergence from the optimum of the isolated organ functioning (see chapter \ref{part:model} for details on the trade-offs at the organ's scale). However, this coordination along a fast-slow axis asks the question of the stability of this strategy. Indeed, the high investment in active tissues observed suggests that the turn-over and respiration costs are high, and a loss in efficiency based on an incorrect estimation of conditions could have strong negative effects. \\



\textbf{The allocation trade-off allows for strategies from the fast-slow spectrum to arise for the shoot and roots based on the perceived condition availabilities with some degrees of coordination, in a coherent framework. Such allocation mechanism can explain coordination thanks to shared cost and increase efficiency when the resource is available. The potential instability of the phenotypes may lead to discrepancies between the optimum defined by the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm and the realised performance landscape. }

\paragraph{The memory concept}

The model \model brings a new approach to agent-based models and plasticity by integrating the resource availability estimation directly as a parameter for the plant development strategy. Despite requiring certain adjustment for an integration with full plasticity (in RMF and organ-specific traits), it reproduces a certain pattern of coordination and overall resource use strategy along resource gradients. It also makes a bridge between the mechanistic approaches, that use species-specific parameters measure on individual plants and species distribution models (SDMs) that focus on abiotic conditions\sidenote{new SDMs now integrate biotic interactions as well as other ecological processes, as suggested by \citet{guisan_predicting_2005}.} and how species distribution match climatic variables. This new framework can allow more exploration at bigger scales with numerous species, that is often the limitations of such agent-based models. However, to make this step, further work is needed on the general assumption that the estimation of conditions coupled with the gain function gives a good proxy to the plant development. There must be a strong positive correlation between the memory, the developed phenotype and the plant performance. 

While this verification seems obvious, difficulties can arise if you consider plant with different levels of plasticity. A non plastic plant will certainly require the same memory as a plastic plant that will be able to adjust this memory. The former should conciliate the memory (and therefore the phenotype) matching the conditions of it growing period with values that limit risks of negative growth outside this favourable period. A mean value of the experienced condition during the growing period is certainly a good value for the memory. This also raises the question of the ontogeny in these models that often consider fixed allocation parameters. In \model, ontogenetic shifts can be mimic under \textit{plastic-optimisation} by having default allocation parameters different from the ones computed by the optimisation algorithm\sidenote{limited here by a first simulation cycle, see methods for details.}. On the other hand, plastic plants should better have a memory that matches the conditions at the early stages of growth, and let the plasticity drive the allocation for the continuation of the development. Also, while the structure of the model lets a door open for the integration of heritability mechanisms (through epigenetic modifications) that are expected to play an important role in the adaptation to the global change, those differences between plastic and non plastic plants may impact the integration of plasticity. This argument also encourages to find alternative solution to model plastic traits. Based on the review by \citet{crisp_reconsidering_2016}, the concept of memory can be conserved but adapted to be more driven by stress levels and stress response/recovery than actual resource availability values. The knowledge of molecular mechanisms of the plant functioning must better inform the modelling routine that is too focused on mathematical and theoretical approaches. The advantage of such specific memory mechanism is that it can be stress specific \sidenote{as suggested in the chapter \ref{part:model}.} and allows the integration of heritability.\\

\textbf{The concept of memory, even if it allows the contrasting phenotype in a continuous space, should take a different form to suit multiple plasticity strategies and integrate a form of heritability. The molecular mechanisms of plastic responses are better understood and provide solid foundations for new organ-specific plasticity.}

\textbf{The model \model integrates trade-offs in resource use driven by the memory in resource availability. The investigation of the allocation patterns driven by the \textit{plastic-optimisation}   algorithm under the assumption of maximisation of the daily growth demonstrates different roles of the phenotypic axes: the RMF largely controls the equilibrium between shoot and root total activities, while the proportion of active tissues are related to the tissue efficiency as well as the overall plant efficiency and resource use strategy. While the fast-slow gradient along resource gradients is reproduced, and organ partial coordination explained, plastic responses to answer quick changes in resources are likely to not be reproduced due to a lack of constraints on the RMF dimension. The effect of the different algorithm, plasticity strategy and resources affect the plant performance still have to be investigated. Despite the pieces of evidence that the \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation mechanisms needs adjustments, the \textit{fixed-equilibrium} algorithm offer a great tool to study the effect of plasticity on plant performances and best strategies.}

\chapter{Individual performance, plasticity\\and variable conditions}\label{chapter:individual}

The previous section highlighted the ability of the model to model growth, but also the importance of species-specific parameters. While the plasticity mechanism did not replicate to a full extent (stable and higher amplitude) the phenotypic changes between the different conditions, there were some changes both in traits and in growth, leading to a higher parameter set selection rate. Considering the importance of species-specific parameters and their potential impact on growth, these differences between plastic and non plastic allocation rules should be investigated in an extended manner. The specific roles of strategy and memory on the multiple components of plant growth need to be disentangled to draw better hypotheses on the role of phenotypic plasticity on plant performance and coexistence. The role of resource availability on these mechanisms also needs to be interrogated. The effect of plasticity on coexistence can also be approached with respect to relative performances and contraction of the strategy space.

This chapter tends to answer these questions with simulations of individual plants with diverse strategies and under multiple allocation rules. To simplify the approach and focus on the interaction between species strategies and allocation algorithm, the plasticity will be modelled as a discrete mechanism (tau = 0 for all plastic allocation algorithms).

\section{Individual performance: between strategy, memory and plasticity}\label{section:landscape}

This first subsection focuses on the link between the phenotype and the plant performance. The plasticity and allocation mechanisms can affect both the link between phenotype and performance and the distribution of the existing phenotypes.

Because little differences are found between accepted parameter sets for the three main algorithms, parameter sets selected for the \textit{non plastic} algorithm are used for all algorithm. To reduce the number of simulations but have a measure of the genericity of the observed patterns, 20 parameter sets are selected among the accepted parameter sets for the \textit{non plastic} allocation algorithm. As mentioned in the previous section, the parameter sets have been selected for only one species-specific and therefore an additional step was used to filter out the parameter sets that could lead to high biomass values. For each parameter set, simulations of diverse phenotypes run for 100 days of 15 hours with favourable temperature conditions (20 \celsius) along resource availability gradient. The parameter sets are selected based on the maximum biomass of all simulated plants. One parameter set is randomly selected for each of the 20 brackets between 0 and 2 grams of total biomass.

\paragraph{Strategy space sampling}
To better understand what makes a plant perform in the model require the growth of a multitude of phenotypes. Tested phenotypes are distributed regularly along the three axes of the strategy space (proportion of active tissues in root, proportion of active tissues in shoot, proportion of roots) between extreme values (respectively (0.1, 0.99), (0.1, 0.99) and (0.1, 0.9)) for a total of 3375 combinations ($15^{3}$).  Because the RSR is defined by the memory, and in this set of simulation experiments the RSR is defined before, the species memory needs to be computed afterwards. There is an infinite number of couples of memory values that can match a given RSR. Also, the projection of conditions is sensitive to both memory and experienced conditions, therefore the choice of memory can affect the relative sensitivity of species to changes in external conditions and alter the model behaviour. Because the role of memory is not the focus here, and because there is interest\sidenote{at this stage of the exploration of the model} on the role of the plasticity as a mechanism (as opposed as a strategy with various values of \texttt{tau}), the parameter \texttt{tau} is set to 0. This ensures that only the starting phenotype and the experienced conditions play a role in plant performance.

\paragraph{Simulation set-up}

For each phenotype a pot simulation is ran for 100 days of 15 hours under 4 millimetres rainfall and 120 Watt per square metres and per hour with the 4 main allocation algorithms (\textit{non plastic}, \textit{fixed-equilibrium}, \textit{fixed-optimisation} and \textit{plastic-optimisation}). Two resource levels are tested for each simulation. The low resource availability conditions correspond to a reduction by a factor 4 of resource influx, but the day length was conserved.

\paragraph{Projections}

To visualise the performance landscape (plant performance relative to biggest plant as a function of its phenotype) the performance of best phenotypes are projected against the 3 plans that compose the phenotypic space. Such projections are preferred to 3D alternatives as they work better with static visualisation and when most of the space is occupied. Alternative axes are defined to facilitate the interpretation and description of the performance landscape: the organ strategy plane (PAR-PAS plane) can be transformed into strategy balance (differences between PAS and PAR) and "speed" (in sense of Reich \parencite{reich_world-wide_2014})(the average allocation to active tissues).

To study the potential effect of resource availability and or allocation mechanism on the link between strategy and performance, an aggregated measure is designed: the \textemph{gravity centre} of the phenotypic space is defined as the average phenotype weighted by the relative performance of each phenotype. It can be defined with respect to the initial strategy, or to take into account the plasticity, to the final position in the phenotypic space. The shift of this gravity centre within the projection space informs of translation of the performance landscape.

\paragraph{Normalisation}

Biomass measures are relative to best performing non plastic plant (to remove the general parameter set effect on growth) and compare (within each condition) the effect of allocation algorithm. %Plasticity lead to an increase of average relative biomass, especially full plasticity. However, few values above 1, under fixed conditions there is a real added value of plasticity compare to fixed allocation.\\


\subsection{Results}

\paragraph{Performance landscape}
The effects of the species-specific parameters on growth are first studied with the analysis of the performance landscape drawn by the growth of plants uniformly distributed in the strategy space.

%The allocation phenotypic space is three-dimensional, but only two dimensions are represented (proportion of active tissues in roots (PAR) and proportion of active tissues in the shoot (PAS)), while the best value of the third (root mass fraction) is used for the projection of the biomass.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:best_phenotypes}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/landscape_PAR-PAS.pdf}
\caption{Projection of best phenotypes (varying RMF) on the 2D PAR-PAS plane for each parameter set. Points identify the optima. \textit{Non plastic}.}
\end{figure}

 On the tissue allocation plan (proportion of active tissues in leaves and roots) (see figure \ref{fig:best_phenotypes}), the best performing phenotypes present a bean shape. This shape covers a good fraction of the space, in the centre and sometimes top-right corner (high active tissue allocation) of the 2D space, while other corners are ignored. Too low values for any of the organs lead to a limited growth. For certain parameter sets, the top-right corner, corresponding to high resource acquisition strategies, has lower growth values than the centre. They have lower growth values than phenotypes with similar values for one of the organs and a lower value for the other organ.  %This shape suggest that relative importance of organ efficiency is lower than other criteria such as equilibrium and overall performance (see section \ref{chapter:modelling_PP} paragraph \ref{subsection:match} for the discussion on the components of plant performance). On this plane, the lowest values of plant biomass are characterised by low values of active tissue allocation. 
 

Projection of the best phenotypes over the three planes also gives information on the importance of the ignored variable on each plane. If the contrast between the growth projected phenotypes is high, at least on the main dimension is crucial for the growth. If the contrast is lower when the variable is ignored (\textit{i.e.} the best value is used) then the projected variable is likely to be important. The projection on PAR-RMF and PAS-RMF (see figure \ref{fig:perf_decomposition}) planes shows a higher contrast between phenotypes relatively to PAR-PAS plane, therefore the RMF is a more sensitive variable than the allocation factors to active tissues in organs.


%Higher resource: contraction of the landscape, toward faster species. Moving optimum and moving gravity centre. Transition to optimum shifting and difference between allocation rules.

\paragraph{Optimum shifting}

Introducing resource availability variations and plasticity can impact the shape of the performance landscape.

A shift of gravity centres can be observed between the two resource levels in all allocation algorithms (see figure \ref{fig:gravity_shift_resource}, the four panels). \textit{Non plastic} and \textit{fixed} algorithm show similar trends with an increase in the proportion of active tissues in both organs. This change toward more exploitative tissues is consistent and can be observed for all parameter sets but one. The \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm show drastically different responses of the gravity centre of phenotypes. There is little change in shoot proportion of active tissues, but a consistent reduction of active tissues in the root system, and a reduction of root mass fraction (data not shown). These two responses indicate a net reduction of root activity in favour of shoot activity. Two things must be taken into consideration while looking at these results: (1) the gravity center is computed from final position into the phenotypic space, not the starting position, (2) because \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm allows changes in traits that are represented (PAR and PAS), shifts along these axes can be driven by the plasticity mechanisms and not neceseraly only performance differences. A similar representation of the gravity centre computed from the initial phenotype (not shown) shows a similar response for the three first algorithms and no apparent shift for the \textit{plastic-optimisation} plasticity.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:gravity_shift_resource}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/ld_gravity_resourceall.pdf}
\caption{Shift on the 2D phenotypic space of the center of gravity as function of resource availability. The center of gravity is defined as the average phenotype weighted by the relative biomass, and characterises the performance landscape.}
\end{figure}

\textit{Non plastic} and \textit{fixed} plasticities respond in a same way to a shift in resource availability. However, we can note that the gravity centres have a lower proportion of active tissues for \textit{fixed} allocation algorithm compared to the \textit{non plastic} one.


%\paragraph{Phenotypic space contraction}
\paragraph{Productivity changes}

Plastic allocation leads to an improvement in mean biomass of all individuals for all three plastic allocation algorithms (see figure \ref{fig:mean_BM_pl}). The \textit{fixed-equilibrium} plants are 2.5 times bigger in average than \textit{non plastic} plants (in low resource conditions), and up to 7 times bigger for \textit{plastic-optimisation} plant. These ratios are relatively similar for high resource availability. 

\begin{figure}\label{fig:mean_BM_pl}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/plot_BM_allocation.pdf}
\caption{Mean relative biomass as a function of allocation algorithm and resource level.}
\end{figure}

However, the maximum biomass is only marginally improved with an increase of 6\% for \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and 8\% for \textit{fixed-optimisation} in low resource condition (see figure \ref{fig:max_BM_pl}). These percentages drop to less than 1\% in high resource availability conditions. The \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm even leads to a decrease in the maximum biomass averaging 10\% and 13\% respectively in low and high resource availability conditions.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:max_BM_pl}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/plot_maxBM_allocation.pdf}
\caption{Maximum biomass relative to the \textit{non plastic} simulations, as a function of allocation algorithm and resource level.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Phenotypic convergence}

The effect of plasticity on the potential diversity is estimated by looking at the species that reach the range of 90\% to 100\% of the maximum biomass within the specific conditions (for each parameter set, algorithm and condition separately).

\begin{figure}\label{fig:species_richness}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/plot_eveness.pdf}
\caption{Proportion of species within the range of 90\% to 100\% of the maximum biomass, as a function of allocation algorithm and resource level.}
\end{figure}

The number of species within this range is extremely low in \textit{non plastic} allocation algorithm simulations, with 1.4\% and 2.1\% respectively for low and high resource conditions. This percentage is greatly improved by plastic allocation algorithm and reach in average 9\% to 15\% of species in \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and \textit{fixed-optimisation} algorithm, while it can reach up to 100 \% for \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm, with a mean proportion of species with a top performance around 72\% in low availability condition, and up to 82\% in high resource availability condition.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:function_div}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/plot_fdiv.pdf}
\caption{Functional volume occupied by the species within the range of 90\% to 100\% of the maximum biomass, as a function of allocation algorithm and resource level.}
\end{figure}

The functional diversity, estimated with the approximate volume of the top phenotypes, follows an opposite trend, with the highest value for the \textit{non plastic} allocation algorithm. \textit{Fixed} algorithms present half the functional volume of the \textit{non plastic} algorithm, and the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm has extremely low values five times lower than the \textit{non plastic} ones.



\subsection{Discussion}

\paragraph{Components of performance}

The study of the performance landscape puts in light the different components of \textemph{plant performance}. To understand how plasticity can play a role, it is important to understand what makes a phenotype a good phenotype. 
% the main axis: 
On one hand, the extent of strategies (plan PAR-PAS in figure \ref{fig:best_phenotypes}) with high relative growth (green area) is high when the best  RMF is considered, while this is greatly reduced on plans that integrate RMF variability (see figure \ref{fig:perf_decomposition}). This result suggests the high importance on this axis for the plants' performance. This can be explained by a stronger effect of this dimension on the exchange area through changes in organ masses, instead of organ densities (affected by PAR and PAS). The RMF fraction impacts the plant performance in two ways: by changing the \textemph{equilibrium} between shoot and root exchange activities, and by changing the global carbon loss rate (respiration and tissue turn-over) if the organs differ on this aspect. These two components may have opposed directions, as the limiting organ may also be the least efficient, and therefore the RMF could be greatly constrained if the two aspects have similar importance. The effect on the equilibrium is likely to be more important as a wide range of RMF values can be observed for numerous datasets (data not shown), and plant with uncoordinated (low-PAS \& high-PAR, or high-PAS \& low-PAR, \see figure \ref{fig:perf_decomposition}) organs still present high biomass values, suggesting that the respiration and turn-over loss are less important than a balanced resource acquisition. 

%NEED THE DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT PERFORMANCE HERE

RMF: root mass fraction, PAR: proportion of active tissues in roots, PAS: proportion of active tissues in the shoot. }
  \label{fig:perf_decomposition}
  }
\end{figure}

On the other hand, the organ-specific strategies are also important as low values for any of the organs (leaves or roots) lead to very low growth. Extreme high values can also be limiting, suggesting the existence of an optimum of the proportion of active tissue for the tissue efficient. This \textemph{optimum tissue efficiency} results from trade-off between active and structural tissues, driven by the relative importance of carbon gain (increased exchange area with active tissues) and carbon loss (increased respiration and turn-over with the proportion of active tissues) that depends on models parameters and resource availability (that change the exchange rate).

\begin{marginfigure}\label{fig:function_div}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/ld_axis.pdf}
\caption{Alternative axes to describe the plant phenotypes on the plan PAR-PAS (PAR: proportion of active tissues in roots, PAS: proportion of active tissues in shoot). The slow-fast axis refers to the proportion of active tissues (close to the fast-slow strategies of \citet{reich_world-wide_2014}), while the orthogonal axis shows how coordinated the plant is (see \citet{freschet_integrated_2015} for similar concept).}
\end{marginfigure}

However, meeting these tissues specific optima might not be sufficient, as the bean shape of the best phenotypes suggests, another component is relevant. Low values of the proportion of active tissue in one organ can be compensated by a high allocation of active tissues in the other organ that allows a higher allocation in the low exchange rate organ. This confirms the importance of the equilibrium over the tissue-specific strategies. But the shape also reveals a last component of the plant performances. The fact that species with high values of the proportion of active tissues in both organs have lower biomass, is certainly due to a limitation of both resources (equilibrium is assumed), reducing the overall efficiency. 

From this visualisation of plant biomass as a function of the phenotypes, three main components play a role. The \textemph{equilibrium}, mostly driven by the changes in RMF is essential to the plant growth. This is explained by a reduction of the exchange rate of the non-limiting organ that greatly reduces its organ-specific efficiency. This \textemph{organ tissue efficiency}, driven by its effective exchange rate, respiration and turn-over, is also an important component of plant performance. Low values of allocation of active tissues greatly reduce this efficiency, but it can be compensated by bigger organs. However, such mechanisms can affect the overall efficiency defined as the average mean of organ realised efficiencies (taking into account resource limitations) weighted by the organ masses. Finally, the \textemph{speed} of the plant, or the overall resource acquisition rate, admits an optimum that is between an over-capacity leading to a co-limitation of resource on both organ reducing their individual efficiencies, and the under-capacity, leading to a sub-optimum use of resources and letting space for competition.

%NEED FIGURE OF EFFICIENCY:

%If equilibrium is a driving mechanisms in plant performance, for any given strategy (PAR-PAS plan projection) the best phenotypes has a RMF values that guarantee the functional equilibrium. However, for each strategy there is a notable difference between the RMF of best phenotypes  and the RMF of phenotypes the closest to the equilibrium. This disparity is positively related to the strategy balance: best phenotypes with higher active allocation in shoot than root have lower allocation to roots than required for functional equilibrium.

%Convergence, relative species diversity and functional diversity.

\paragraph{Convergence to subspace}

The phenotypic plasticity allows species to move within this performance landscape along certain axes. It is often perceived with a species-centric perspective, that is to say, that plasticity is seen as variations in the species mean phenotype. However, in the context of community ecology, it is also interesting to try to see how it not only affects individual species but shapes the community distribution in the strategy space. The plasticity relies on changes of default phenotypes toward "better" strategies in the context of the given conditions, therefore it implies that if it exists an optimum subspace (one strategy or an ensemble of strategies) species will converge toward this subspace, distorting the functional space. Environmental variations and plant interactions aside, in a constant environment the \textemph{performance landscape} is fixed. As a consequence, the plasticity benefits to the plant in a static manner, that is to say, it is only a tool to reach a better phenotype where the plant stays in if conditions do not change. This can be related to spatial heterogeneity that would lead individuals from the same species to adopt different phenotype to acclimate to the particular conditions of their spatial situation. It is opposed to the perception of a more dynamic phenotypic plasticity as a tool for a given individual to cope with temporal variations in environmental conditions. These two aspects are further discussed in the following section, while the effects of the contraction of the phenotypic space are discussed now.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:convergence}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Landscape/ld_convergence.pdf}
\caption[Convergence patterns]{Convergence patterns on a 2D phenotypic fitness landscape, with 1 plastic dimension (A \& B) or 2 plastic dimensions (C, D \& E). Plasticity can lead to high convergence (A, C and E) with potentially high fitness evenness, especially in space with numerous plastic dimensions (A \& E), this is problematic especially if the point of convergence is not the optimum (E). Limits to high convergence are necessary to allow realistic functional diversity with plasticity (B \& D).}
\end{figure}

As just mentioned, the plasticity can be seen at the scale of the species assembly \sidenote{Here I draw a distinction between species assembly that refers to all present species, and community that refers to the interacting individuals of the present species. However, some interpretations can be translated to communities.} as a contraction of the phenotypic space of the species assembly. This contraction has two main effects: the reduction of potential functional diversity and a reduction of growth rate differences. There is here an emerging trade-off between the \textemph{species diversity}, supported by lower fitness differences, and \textemph{functional diversity}, reduced by the contraction of the phenotypic space. However, if the plasticity reduces greatly the potential functional diversity (volume of the whole phenotypic space without considering filtering based on relative fitness), the realised diversity (expressed as the functional diversity of the species within the 90\%-100\% maximum biomass range) is less impacted because a large parts of the phenotypic space have low growth rate in the given conditions. Nevertheless, there is a reduction in the diversity of expressed phenotypes. Indeed, in this scenario of "extreme" plasticity ($\tau = 0$) the convergence is important on plastic dimensions while partial convergence would be enough to have good fitness (see conceptual figure \ref{fig:convergence}). Lower convergence on plastic dimension should lead to less compact phenotypic subspace while keeping relative fitness evenness. In the case of \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and \textit{fixed-optimisation} allocation mechanisms, this reduction of diversity is lower because only one axis is plastic.

A reduction of the phenotypic convergence can be achieved by other allocation mechanisms, differences in projection (different $\tau$ values leading to different projections) and plasticity costs. In a heterogeneous system, this convergence is expected to be lower as heterogeneity will lead to different projections. The constraints imposed by fixed traits also reduce the risk of convergence (lower convergence in panel A than in panel C in figure \ref{fig:convergence}), and other dimensions than the 3 studied here can be involved in the definition of the optimum (chemical traits for example) lead to larger optimum sub-space.


\paragraph{On diversity}

The question of diversity is essential in ecology, it often refers to the species richness, or to different indexes to measure this richness or characterise the community structure. In the context of the ecosystem functioning and services, the functional diversity is often preferred to characterise the community. To measure the functional diversity, the selection of the measured traits has an importance. Once these axes defined, multiple indexes can be used, considering the relative species abundances or the distances between measured traits \parencite{laliberte_distance-based_2010}. Here, in the context of simulations with species diverging only of the 3 vegetative phenotypic axes, the functional diversity is expressed an estimation of the functional volume occupied by the species with top performance within this 3D space. But, because under certain allocation algorithms, some dimensions are plastic, it is difficult to study how plasticity impacts the functional diversity. The plasticity of an axis can lead to convergence and certainly reduce the potential functional diversity as only a subspace is considered. This is problematic in this context because there is a high convergence due to the specific implementation of the plasticity based on a shared gain function (equilibrium or growth-optimisation), but is certainly reduced if the algorithm allow contrasted responses (with response curves for example), or optimum phenotypes depending on the other traits as it is the case for \textit{fixed} algorithms (as opposed as the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm). Because of this phenomenon of convergence, that cannot be totally avoided and is inherent to the concept of plasticity, the functional diversity should be considered in relation with the species diversity. The functional volume is reduced by a factor between 1 and 2, while the species richness is increased by a factor from 5 to 10 (see figures \ref{fig:function_div}, \& \ref{fig:species_richness}). While the ratio between functional and species diversity decreases in plastic conditions, the overall effect on diversity could be positive, especially if there are other traits (non considered here) correlated to the initial phenotype. 

%Cost and distance, sensitivity to environmental cues as solutions to this problem. 
\paragraph{Limited gain}

The convergence of the phenotypes to a sub-space of lower performance lead to an increase in the mean biomass (see figure \ref{fig:max_BM_pl}). However, the maximum biomass is only marginally improved in \textit{fixed} plastic allocation simulations, and reduced in \textit{plastic optimisation} allocation simulations. These two contrasting results show different effects of plasticity. The light increase can be due to either a dynamic gain or a static gain. The \textemph{dynamic gain} can emerge because the plant growth affects the resource availability, changing the optimum phenotype, and allowing plastic plants to follow these changes over time. It could also result from a \textemph{static gain} because the phenotypic plasticity allows a better resolution in tested phenotypes (the plastic axis are continuous while the phenotypic space sampling was discrete). The role of plasticity and dynamic gain is explored in the following sections with temporal resource heterogeneity.

The reduction of the maximum biomass highlights the difficulty to find the optimum phenotype. Because, the growth mechanisms are reproduced in an exact manner in the plasticity algorithm, this mismatch is certainly due to a difficulty to project the future of resource availability. Because of that, it is possible that the gain in maximum biomass, mentioned above, due to static or dynamic gain is greater than it appears. The particular case of mis-projection in \textit{plastic-optimisation} simulations is discussed in the following paragraph. \\

\textbf{Phenotypic plasticity can lead to a certain degree of convergence, especially if the target phenotypes defined by the implementation of the plasticity are more condition-specific than species-specific. While it can have strong effects on the functional diversity for the plastic traits, it also leads to high species richness due to a convergence toward a more performing subspace, and can potentially increase the total functional diversity if other traits are considered and the phenotypes more constrained. }

%Because of high convergence of \textit{plastic-optimisation}, no improvement of maximum biomass, but the \textit{fixed} alternative thanks to convergence limited to one phenotypic dimension (RMF) higher biomass: either higher resolution or improvement due to \textemph{dynamic plasticity}. The role of dynamic plasticity benefit is explored in temporal variation simulations in the following section.


%Somehow I need to talk about the cost of being wrong. Can be observed in the delta heatmap on delta strat and delta w-ini: in this case, there is less impact of being wrong of memory if you're good with strategy, because your not in different conditions...\\

%Potential effect on diversity: lower functional diversity, increase evenness. Leave highest fitness spot free. Why ? environmental cues or gain function? Delta between projections? \\

%Anyway, being good is stable conditions may useless if cannot survive or keep gain in other conditions. >> look along gradient if best species keep their rank.\\


\paragraph{Plastic exhaustion}

The \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm is characterised by a high convergence of the species within the phenotypic space, high mean biomass but maximum biomass lower than best \textit{non plastic} phenotype, and high potential species diversity. The convergence is expected and explained by the fact that all three traits are plastic and all species (for a given resource level) experience similar conditions leading to the computation of the same optimum. The absence of plasticity cost limiting the convergence leads to a phenotype concentration toward this optimum. This convergence explains both the high potential species diversity, as all species have very similar growth rate, and the relatively high mean biomass because only a few species did not survive or had very little growth rate.

The fact that this plasticity does not translate into higher maximum biomass is surprising, especially considering the fact that RMF plasticity improves maximum biomass (see figure \ref{fig:mean_BM_pl}). Lag in adaptation is often identified as a limit of plasticity \parencite{dewitt_costs_1998, van_kleunen_constraints_2005}, nevertheless, in a constant resource influx experiment, and considering the high phenotypic flexibility of plants in \model, this explanation is unlikely. Another problem highlighted with plasticity is its adaptiveness. Evolutionarily speaking, it is hard to imagine the emergence and maintenance of a plasticity mechanism (in a given context) if it is no adaptive. Yet, such process could be maladaptive in a new context. Because plasticity is not emerging but imposed by the simulation set up, its adaptiveness can be discussed. Here adaptiveness does not refer to a reduction of fitness due to plasticity but to the capacity of the plastic mechanism to define an optimum (or at least better) phenotype. Plasticity, as implemented in the model, has no explicit bias and all mechanisms involved in plant growth are simulated by the allocation algorithm. The sampling of phenotypes is random and could be a source of uncertainty, but it is uniform and no consistent drift is likely to emerge from the noise introduced by such sampling. The last aspect of plasticity that can affect the adaptiveness of plasticity is the estimation of conditions. The estimation of conditions is based on the resource levels experienced by the plant and by definition are exact. Thus, the problem lies in the projection of these conditions and how they translated into resource uptakes.


\begin{figure}\label{fig:exchange_volume_projection}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Concepts/exchange_volume_projection.pdf}
\caption{Projection of the water volume exchange after increase in exchange area at equilibrium and with no limitation.}
\end{figure}

In \model the resource availability is coded as an uptake rate per day and per unit of exchange area and is computed as the resource uptake divided by the exchange area. This resource availability is supposed constant, and plants make the assumption that increasing their exchange area leads to a proportional increase in resource volume exchanged (see figure \ref{fig:exchange_volume_projection}).

\begin{figure}\label{fig:exhaustion}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Concepts/exhaustion2.pdf}
\caption{Projection of the water volume exchange after an increase in exchange area when total available water volume is limiting. The water volume exchanged cannot exceed the total available water volume, leading to a systematic over-estimation of water availability and offset between shoot and root activity.}
\end{figure}

However, in the case where a plant already absorbs all the available resource, then this assumption is not respected, and the uptake rate per area is lower than expected (see figure \ref{fig:exhaustion} right panel, realised exchanged volume does not match the projection because it cannot exceed the total volume of available water). This gap between perception and actual resource availability occurs because the plant is not able to perceive that the limitation cannot be compensated by a higher investment in the limiting organ. This behaviour explains a very high investment toward root and root active tissues in low resource conditions under \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation (figure \ref{fig:gravity_shift_resource}). This gap\sidenote{this is different from a lag because it is not the result of slow changes in phenotype but comes from a default in the estimation of the optimum phenotype.} is the cause of the \textemph{plastic exhaustion} phenomenon. Indeed, this constant over-estimation leads to a constant discrepancy between the estimated optimum phenotype and the actual phenotype, and a larger allocation to root active tissues. This effect is particularly noticeable in the context of pot simulations where the water pool is limited. The absence of plasticity costs also favours such extreme behaviour. 

Despite this particular, seemingly non-adaptive behaviour, the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm is still interesting to study in the context of community simulations. First, the presence of plasticity cost should limit such extreme behaviours. Second, in a context of competition in a larger environment, this aggressive search behaviour is likely to be an advantage against individuals with less aggressive, or stable strategy. Finally, this mechanism emerges in constant influx conditions that allow growth, but its emergence should be reduced in a variable environment where water shortage leads to reduced growth.

The plastic exhaustion mechanism seems to be contradictory with the previous observation that the proportion of active tissues does not increase when the related resource is limiting (see figure \ref{fig:memory_n_phenotype}), but it can be argued that it such extreme case, if the RMF has extreme values and is constrained by differences in tissue efficiencies. This is not verified, however.

\textit{Plastic-optimisation} simulations expose large amplitude of plastic exhaustion. This effect is possible with other allocation algorithms, but with negligible amplitude. The difference in magnitude can be explained by a less effective growth in early stages of development for \textit{fixed} plasticities (when \textit{plastic-optimisation} is more efficient than fixed plasticities) that delay the time when the total volume is reached (time \textit{t} in figure \ref{fig:exhaustion}), and in average lower active tissue allocation in roots that leads to lower loss due to non-equilibrium.\\

\textbf{Plastic exhaustion is a specific limit of phenotypic plasticity as implemented in \model that relies on the assumption of constant exchange rate per exchange area. It has a large effect in the specific case of pot simulations. This mismatch between the projection and the reality of environmental conditions lead to an unbalanced phenotype and a large reduction in growth rate. However, this phenomenon can be mitigated by plasticity cost linked to changes in traits and can have adaptive value in a context of competition. Therefore, I argue that \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm  has low information value in the context of pot simulations with constant resource influx, but should still be studied in the context of community dynamics.}

%\paragraph{On diversity}
%Effects on diversity.\\ I would put that aside for now
%
%The potential functional diversity is amplified by the fact that many phenotypes that are not viable in any condition but becomes viable thanks to the static gain of plasticity. These species exist in the context of the simulation because there is no cost to plasticity. Because species are uniformly sampled in the 3D, a lot of them could not grow in a lot of conditions?

\paragraph{Resource availability}

%results from this part\\
As expected the resource availability and the resource balance are key components of the plant growth, to which the plant phenotype needs to match. Aside from the increase in biomass, an increase in "speed" of optimum phenotypes can result from higher resource availability. This observation is in agreement with empirical data that demonstrate higher SLA and faster physiology in favourable conditions. This aspect was less obvious in the response of species under \textit{plastic-optimisation} allocation that shifted more in term of balance and RMF. This may be due to a change in the relative balance between both resources as their availability (from the plant perspective) are linked to the global resource levels by non-linear relationships.

The fact that plastic plants (for \textit{fixed} allocation algorithms) show shifts of optimum strategies toward more exploitative phenotypes, in addition to the \textit{non plastic} optimum shifts, in conditions of higher productivity demonstrate the importance of these strategies for the plant growth. However, the extent of this effect of conditions on optimum phenotype is susceptible to vary along a gradient. Indeed, because of the non-linearity of relationships between resource levels and exchanges rates, and between exchange rates and growth rates, the link between the optimum phenotype and a resource gradient is likely to be non-linear itself. In addition, phenotypic plasticity might also change the sensitivity of the phenotype to the resource level.\\


\textbf{The study of the performance landscape highlights the importance of the RMF phenotypic dimension to regulate the balance between shoot and root. On the other hand, the proportion of active tissues in the two compartments impacts the performance in a more subtle way with the possibility of balance between the two organs thanks to the RMF. It also highlights the existence of a tight sub-space with higher performances, leading to high convergence under plastic allocation. This convergence can be problematic if the plasticity fails to be adaptive under specific circumstances. It can lead to a reduction of the functional diversity, but also increases the species diversity, altering the species-functional diversity relationship with potential consequences on the community functioning. The performance landscape is sensitive to the global resource availability, altering the relative fitness of species and their competitive relationships. This effect must be further studied to understand the link between the optimum phenotypes and the resource availability heterogeneity, and how plasticity can impact this link. }

\section{Plasticity and variability of conditions}
%Question I try to answer: (use of schematics ?)
The heterogeneity of conditions is an essential mechanism for plant coexistence. Plasticity is likely to alter the effect of this heterogeneity on plant coexistence and relative performance. The impact of plasticity on this relationship between spatial and temporal \textemph{heterogeneity} of resources (here limited to water) and strategy dominance is explored with the model \model.

How does plasticity impact the performance of the different phenotype along a resource gradient? How can these potential changes affect the identity, diversity and productivity of mountain grassland communities?

%The phenotypic plasticity can impact the optimum strategy, but how does this effect impact the optimum phenotype along a resource availability gradient?
%Effect on optimum strategy: from previous conclusions and hypothesis to simulation method.\\

%Is the contraction effect on species richness, functional diversity and productivity changing along such gradient?
%Then on diversity: how good strategies perform when it is plastic. The pool of species that exist in different conditions to get rid of the static effect.

\subsection{Method}

Because the coordination is shown to be less important than the equilibrium, the below-ground resource acquisition is expected to be important in mountain grassland under climate change scenarios, and an extensive simulation plan comes with a high computational cost, only root strategies are sampled and studied in this part. Considering the structure of the model, the conclusions about the root compartment can certainly be extended to the shoot compartment.

\paragraph{Simulation set-up}
For each of the 20 selected parameter sets, the growth of 400 plants (20 PAR values between 0.25 and 0.95, and 20 memory values between 0.1 and 1) is simulated for 100 days in square pots of 12 centimetres deep and 90 centimetres wide (to avoid quick self-competition) in a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius during the day of 15 hours, and 10 degrees during the night. The radiance is set to the high values of 122 Watt per hour and per square metre. Because \textit{fixed} algorithms showed similar results, and the \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm show strange results, only two allocation algorithms are simulated: \textit{non plastic} and \textit{fixed-equilibrium}.

\paragraph{Spatial heterogeneity}
Spatial heterogeneity of water level is mimicked by a gradient of water influx. The growth of all 400 species described above are simulated for \textit{non plastic} and \textit{fixed-equilibrium} algorithm independently in separated simulations where the water influx is regularly sampled between 0.05 and 7 mm per day (20 values).

\paragraph{Temporal heterogeneity}
A similar set-up is used for temporal heterogeneity simulations. Because the range of water influx used in the previous simulation is too wide, a lower value is chosen as the mean water influx. This value of 1.3mm per day corresponds to a point around which there are variations in the optimum strategies for most parameter sets. It is also relatively close to average rainfalls in the Alps during summer. 

\subsection{Results: gradient of homogeneous precipitation conditions}

\paragraph{Optimum strategy}

To study the effect of plasticity on community identity along with a precipitation gradient, we can look at the position of the optimum strategy (PAR) along with such gradient with different allocation algorithms.

%%Only look at the median of best strat. Gravity centre lower for fixed-equilibrium, because of a few more species living.

The effect of allocation algorithm is observed on all species by plotting the position of the median \textit{optimum} along the watering gradient that translates what part of the strategy spectrum (from conservative to exploitative) benefit from the simulation conditions. At the low end of the gradient, conservative species exhibit higher growth than exploitative species with a median optimum around 25\% of active tissues in roots for both the \textit{non plastic}and the \textit{fixed-equilibrium} plastic allocation. In the other end of the spectrum, for watering values above 1 mm per day, the \textit{optimum} reaches a high point (median around 90\% of active tissues for both algorithms) demonstrating the better performance of the exploitative species in high resource availability conditions.  There are no apparent differences between algorithms and the optimum is conserved along the gradient. There is a similar shift with an increase of optimum water availability memory for \textit{non plastic} algorithm.


\begin{figure}\label{fig:gradient_strat_trend}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Rain/gradient_strat_trend.pdf}

The color ribbon marks the band between the 5th and 95th percentiles.} % Maybe I should change that so it is the 25th and 75th like for variable inputs.
\end{figure}

The memory of water availability of best-performing phenotypes increases along the gradient under \textit{non plastic} allocation (see figure \ref{fig:gradient_w_ini_trend}, left panel), but the plasticity negates the effect of this species-specific parameter and no clear pattern can be observed (right panel).

The color ribbon marks the band between the 5th and 95th percentiles.} % Maybe I should change that so it is the 25th and 75th like for variable inputs.
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Productivity}

The total cumulative biomass of all plants increases along the precipitation gradients. The plastic simulations have a cumulative biomass that is twice the biomass of \textit{non plastic} simulations.
%Strongly affect the potential overall productivity captured by cumulative biomass.


\begin{figure}\label{fig:total_BM}

  }
\end{figure}

The effect on the maximum biomass is also investigated. For most simulation the maximum biomass is unchanged, and the median of the maximum biomass follow the same path for both conditions. However, the 75th and the 95th percentiles of plastic simulations show a high increase in maximum biomass.
% But, only marginally (for a few parameter sets) increases the biomass of best species.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:maximum_BM}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Rain/gradient_rel_BM_pl_trend.pdf}
\caption[Maximum biomass relative along a precipitation gradient]{Median (bold line \textbf{--}) maximum biomass relative to the best performing plant in the most favourable condition for each parameter set, along a precipitation gradient.

The color ribbons mark the bands between the 5th and 95th and between the 25th and 75th percentiles.}
\end{figure}

%That probably means more species reaching high-performance levels.

\paragraph{Diversity}

Similarly to the previous results, the potential diversity is estimated with the number of species, or the functional volume, of the species within the 90\%-100\% range of the maximum biomass for the given conditions.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:species_richness_grad}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Rain/gradient_plot_spdiv10.pdf}
\caption[Species richness of the best performing species along a precipitation gradient]{Median (bold line \textbf{--}) species richness of the species within the range 90\%-100\% of highest biomass for any given condition (parameter and precipitation) along a precipitation gradient.  Colour distinguishes plasticity treatments: \textcolor{myOrange}{-- \textit{non plastic}} \&  \textcolor{myGreen}{-- \textit{fixed-equilibrium}}. The color ribbon marks the band between the 5th and 95th percentiles.} \end{figure}

The species richness decreases along the gradient under the two plasticity treatments. The medians of species richness reach the low point for the same precipitation values than the medians of the optimum reach the highest values. The \textit{fixed-equilibrium} simulations show highest species richness along the whole gradient (except for one parameter set).

\begin{figure}\label{fig:functional_div_grad}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Rain/gradient_plot_fdiv10.pdf}
\caption[Functional diversity of the best performing species along a precipitation gradient]{Median (bold line \textbf{--}) estimation of the functional volume occupied by the species within the range 90\%-100\% of highest biomass for any given condition (parameter and precipitation) along a precipitation gradient.  Colour distinguishes plasticity treatments: \textcolor{myOrange}{-- \textit{non plastic}} \&  \textcolor{myGreen}{-- \textit{fixed-equilibrium}}. The color ribbon marks the band between the 5th and 95th percentiles.} \end{figure}

The functional volume occupied by the top species also decreases for both plasticity when the precipitations increase. For low watering values the functional volume of \textit{non plastic} simulation is higher, however this difference disappears when both groups of simulations reach low functional diversity.

\paragraph{Fundamental niche}

%A lot of effects discussed here emerge because a lot of different memories (equivalently RMF values) are associated to each resource use strategy for roots (shoot active tissue allocation being fixed and shared by all species). Another way of looking at the effect of plasticity focuses on only species identified as the best in at least one of the rain conditions. This focus reduces the number of species to species selected along with such gradient and allows to ignore species that would not be present anyway. This selection does not take into account any competitive mechanisms that could change the identity of the dominant species in a given condition. Nevertheless, information on how the relative performance of these species can still be collected.

%The potential effect of plasticity on niche breadth is visualised here for one representative parameter set.
The median performance of the best performing phenotypes for each condition of the gradient is compared with and without RMF plasticity (\textit{fixed-equilibrium}) along the gradient. It is limited to the best phenotypes to mimic a degree of biotic filtering. The plasticity greatly enhance the ability of the plants to maintain a high growth, often comparable to the one of the best phenotype, along the gradient. The extreme low value of the gradient shows no differences between phenotypes because the water level does not allow plant to grow, only the organic matter content is the seed is used, leading to similar outputs. As seen in figure \ref{fig:gradient_strat_trend}, the best phenotypes often share the same strategy, but differ in memory for resource availability (figure \ref{fig:gradient_strat_trend}). Under \textit{fixed-equilibrium} allocation (right panel), the left end of the gradient (except the first value of precipitation) shows more contrast in the performances in strategies, while the right end (more water) shows very little contrast. This is very different from the \textit{non plastic} allocation results (left panel) that shows large differences between the best strategies along the whole gradient.

\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Rain/optimum_shifting_median.pdf}
\caption{Median relative performance of best phenotypes along a precipitation gradient for 20 parameter sets.}
\end{figure}

%The effect of the plasticity on the potential niche can be observed by looking at the cumulative number of species within the 91\%-100\% range of maximum biomass along the gradient (figure \ref{fig:gradient_ranges}). For all parameter sets, there is an increase in the number of species

\subsection{Discussion: gradient of homogeneous conditions}

\paragraph{Strategy shift}
Along the watering gradient, the \textemph{optimum strategy} (active tissue allocation in roots) changes from conservative toward exploitative. This shift demonstrates that the trade-off between active and structural tissues allocation allows different strategies to dominate in contrasting conditions \parencite{wright_worldwide_2004}. This shift occurs for low values of the gradient and exploitative strategies are dominant over a large part of this gradient. The shape of the relationship results from the gradient including high precipitation values. Also, the low resolution of the strategies (15 values for the proportion of active tissues in roots) limits the possible number of different dominant strategies along such gradient. Because we can see a wide range of optimum of resource-use strategies, and the relationship between this variable and the resource availability is certainly continuous, we can be confident with the pattern observed and a positive relationship between these two variables.

% a few words on the memory
The optimum memory also shows a shift, from low water availability memory in low water conditions, to high values in high water availability conditions. This response is less strong than for the optimum strategy certainly because the relationship is more linear. The fact that the plasticity negates this relationship confirms the role of this variable as a control on the RMF, control that is no longer useful under plastic allocation with no cost.

%Explain why there is a shift
This shift in memory is trivial to understand as the memory of light availability is fixed and the ratio between light and water memory controls the RMF. An increase in the memory (for \textit{non plastic} plants) translates directly in a reduction of the RMF. The shift in optimum is less obvious, despite being described in the literature. The core of this trade-off is the trade-off between tissue efficiency and exchange rates. The more conservative species are more resource-efficient as they consume less resource to produce a bigger amount of organic matter, allowing them to be productive even in low resource conditions. On the other hand, exploitative species have a lower resource-efficiency but can exchange more resources thanks to high exchange rates per unit of biomass. This differences are illustrated in the figure \ref{fig:asymmetric_gain}, in high resource availability conditions (left panel) the exploitative species B show higher growth, despite having lower efficiency (costs relative to gain are higher), while its growth is lower when the gains are reduced linearly by a reduction of the exchange rate due to lower resource availability. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Variable/explain_assymetry.pdf}
\caption[Optimum strategy and resource availability]{\textcolor{myGreen}{Gain} and \textcolor{myOrange}{losses} curves along the allocation strategy axis for one organ. Left panel corresponds to a high resource availability, the right panel illustrates the effect of a 30\% loss of gain due to a reduction of the resource availability. The botton bar plots represent the net gain of two distinct phenotype in the two conditions.}\label{fig:asymmetric_gain}
\end{figure}

The maximum exchange rate influencing the slope of the gain function not only depends on the resource availability but also the non-limitation by the other organ or by regulation functions (see examples in \citet{lohier_analyse_2016}).

% why plasticity does not help.
When the limitation of the exchange rate is only dependent on the conditions, and the equilibrium is insured by the optimum RMF, in constant conditions the phenotypic plasticity cannot alter the optimum phenotype. This result supports the idea that plasticity should not induce a shift in the dominant strategy if the environmental conditions are stables.

% no consequences on the community identity.


%\paragraph{Static and dynamic gain}
%\paragraph{Who benefits from plasticity}
%
%Gains from the plasticity can be distinguished between static and dynamic gains. The lower value of the \textit{center of gravity} in conditions of low water availability under \textit{fixed-e"quilibrium} algorithm seems to indicate that conservative strategies benefit from plastic allocation more than exploitative species. However, this effect is mostly due to static gain as the optimum strategy does not change. This effect is due to a growth landscape flatter than in better conditions (more species within the 90-100 \% of maximum growth, lower growth difference with the best strategy) and asymmetric, that has two effects:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item it reduces the growth gain for species with strategy close to the optimum, but not at the equilibrium (figure \ref{fig:optimum_shift} panel A);
%\item increases the potential gain (relative to less flat growth landscape) for species with strategies more conservative than the optimum (figure \ref{fig:optimum_shift} panel A).
%\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Static gain}

% static gain idea
The cumulative productivity of all species combined is largely improved by the plasticity for all parameter sets (see figure \ref{fig:total_BM}). However, the best total biomass is only improved for a fraction of these parameter sets (see figure \ref{fig:maximum_BM}), while it remains similar in most of others parameter sets between \textit{non plastic} and \textit{fixed-equilibrium} simulations. This observation supports the idea that the total biomass is mostly increased due to an improvement of plants with a non-optimum phenotype, and not an improvement of the best phenotypes. Moreover, while the number of species reaching high-performance levels increases with plasticity (corroborating the previous conclusion), the functional diversity does not increase. We can conclude that the phenotypic plasticity leads to a convergence of the plants toward good performance phenotypes. Therefore, the productivity gain provided by the plasticity comes mainly from the convergence toward the best fixed phenotype, and cumulative static gain.

This form of gain provided by the phenotypic plasticity can be called \textemph{static gain}, as it is capped by the best performing constant phenotype. It is illustrated in the figure \ref{fig:filter}. The gain only comes from the transition from a sub-optimum phenotype toward the best one (see  \textcolor{myOrange}{starting phenotype A}  shifting toward the green one). The gain can be quantified as the total biomass difference between the non plastic species (- - dashed line) and the plastic one (- continuous line).  In constant condition, the best phenotype cannot benefit from the plasticity because it has the highest growth rate along time and has no static gain (\textcolor{myGreen}{starting phenotype B}). 


\begin{figure}\label{fig:filter}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Rain/filtering.pdf}
\caption[Abiotic filtering in constant conditions]{Conceptual representation of the abiotic filtering in constant conditions and the illustration of the static gain.

The middle panel is the growth rate as a function of the phenotype for two positions in time. The bottom panel illustrates the growth curves for the different phenotypes. Two alternative position \textcolor{myOrange}{A} and \textcolor{myGreen}{B} represent a sub-optimum and the optimum position without plasticity (dashed lines). Alternative plastic trajectories are represented by continuous lines. }
\end{figure}

% abiotic filtering, constant filter
The static gain allows species to persist in environmental conditions that do not fit their initial phenotype (\textcolor{myOrange}{A -- continuous line}), and go through the \textemph{abiotic filter} while the non plastic equivalents (\textcolor{myOrange}{A - - dashed line}) cannot. This reduction of the impact of the abiotic filter can have large impacts on the community properties.

% convergence idea This mechanism does not consistently support a functional diversity of the vegetative traits, but it can increase functional redundancy. The species diversity can be increased by this form of gain, and it may limit the vulnerability of the community if multiple species have the function.

% other dimensions diversity
%The functional convergence is obvious when only the vegetative dimensions are observed. But the functional diversity may be considered for other traits, therefore the promotion of species richness by the reduction of fitness differences can promote the functional diversity of the community. 


\paragraph{Niche widening}

The phenotypic plasticity of the RMF leads to an important widening of the fundamental niche. This is explained by the removal of one constraint of the niche. Indeed, with cost-free plasticity in RMF, the equilibrium is almost guaranteed for all species and the resource-use strategy is the only limitation of a species niche. Because the best proportion of active tissues is the same for a long portion of the gradient (high water availability)(see figure \ref{fig:gradient_strat_trend}), along with the gradient most of best phenotypes share this resource-use strategy. Therefore, along with this same gradient, if the RMF axis is ignored, the different species have equivalent phenotypes (except for a few first growing days).

This niche widening has for consequence a higher niche overlapping. This overlapping can be translated into lower niche differences, as the niches are now discriminated only on one dimension, and into lower fitness differences as the species with similar strategies but different memories have close performances under plastic allocation. According to \citet{turcotte_phenotypic_2016} these two processes have opposed effects (see figure \ref{fig:plasticity-effect} in chapter \ref{part:literature}) on the species diversity. On one hand, the reduction of the niche differences diminishes the positive effect of the spatial heterogeneity on diversity. On the other hand, the reduction of fitness differences reduces the competitive exclusion of the non-dominant species and limits the abiotic filtering. The current simulations do not allow to tell which effect will be the strongest at the community scale. The cost of plasticity should nevertheless ensure some degree of niche differentiation. In addition to these two effects, the widening of the fundamental niche corresponds to a reduction of the abiotic filtering pressure and should promote the diversity as more species can potentially invade a habitat. 

\paragraph{Competition effect}

The reduction of the abiotic filtering implies a potential increase in the biotic filtering due to the limited carrying capacity of the habitat. This could raise the competition intensity, especially at the beginning of the growing season, and eventually change the dominant species if this increase is strong enough to alter the competition outcome toward more competitive species. Unless the eventual new dominant species has a dramatic effect of the overall productivity or diversity, the effect of the phenotypic plasticity through the competition should be positive or null on these properties. But because the phenotypic plasticity does not alter directly the optimum phenotype in temporally fixed conditions, the impact on the dominant resource-use strategy should be rather limited.

\paragraph{Meta-community dynamics}

While the effects at the community level are still hard to define, the phenotypic plasticity can alter the dynamic at the meta-community scale. Phenotypic plasticity, by reducing the abiotic filtering effect, allows for a stronger link between the communities as the chance to transfer from one community to another are higher. Therefore this mechanism has a positive effect on the stability of the ecosystem as species from unperturbed communities can invade, and partly sustain the properties and services of the perturbed community.

In a context of global change, to survive two options are possible: (1) migrate to new habitat with suited conditions, (2) adapt to new condition in the same habitat. In this context, the phenotypic plasticity facilitates both the adaptation to new conditions in the same spatial habitat and the adaptation to a new habitat that match the ideal conditions only to a certain degree. By facilitating the adaptation to new conditions or habitat, the phenotypic plasticity reduces the relative importance of climatic variables compared to the competition as already suggested by empirical results \parencite{alexander_novel_2015}.\\

\begin{figure}\label{fig:rain_pl_effect}

}{
\caption[Effect of plasticity in constant conditions]{Effect of the phenotypic plasticity on the main properties of the grassland communities in constant conditions.}
}
\end{figure}

\textbf{In constant environmental conditions, the phenotypic plasticity already has an impact on species performances and interactions through the static gain it provides to some species. The species that benefit from this static gain have the optimum resource-use strategy, but a wrong estimation (memory) of the resource availability. It increases the fitness evenness of species by reducing the abiotic filtering dimensionality down to the resource-use strategy, axis not influenced by the plasticity. This leads to a convergence of the phenotypes and a widening of the fundamental niche. The effects at the community level are hard to anticipate, but they will be largely dependent on the competitive interactions and how they are affected by the plasticity. The reduction of the abiotic filtering will likely increase the species diversity, but the functional diversity might not follow this trend due to functional convergence. The effects on the other component of the ecosystem properties cannot be fully determined and greatly depend on the outcome of the competitive interactions. In temporally heterogeneous conditions, the phenotypic plasticity may play a larger role and greatly mediate the community's properties.}


%\textbf{Mostly static gain, but even if there is gain, increases the potential niche of species that are settled. Bigger niche: favourable for conservative species of rare habitats.\\
%Hard to tell anything on coexistence, except wider niches}



\subsection{Results: gradient of heterogeneous precipitation conditions}

This part of the chapter presents the results at the individual scale along a gradient of a temporal increasing variability of the underground resource (increasing negative slope of water influx).

\paragraph{Productivity}
The maximum biomass (relative to the \textit{non plastic} best performance in constant watering conditions) decreases along the gradient for all allocation algorithms (see figure \ref{fig:variable_BM}). The \textit{non plastic} algorithm shows a drastic drop after the fourth level of variation, while the fixed-trait algorithms show better performances in this part of the gradient. The \textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm shows low growth for all conditions, but a more stable performance.

In contrast with the stable conditions (see previous results) the plasticity provide, in non-constant conditions a great improvement in the maximum biomass for most parameter sets. 

\begin{figure}\label{fig:variable_BM}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Variable/var_relnone_BM_trend.pdf}

The dotted lines in the top-left frame indicate the median biomass for the other three algorithms. The color ribbons mark the bands between the 5th and 95th and between the 25th and 75th percentiles. }
\end{figure}

%
%Along the temporal heterogeneity gradient the median biomass of the optimum phenotypes decreases under all allocation algorithms when the variability increases despite the same mean water influx. The amplitude of reduction varies with the allocation mechanism: \textit{non plastic} algorithm shows the largest decrease while \textit{fixed traits} algorithms show a slower decrease. \textit{Plastic- optimisation} simulations have more constant performances with low initial performances in constant condition (between 5\% and 55\% on the \textit{non plastic} simulation), but they end with slightly better performances than \textit{non plastic} simulation for the extreme case of variation (two extreme regimes).

\paragraph{Identity}

In addition to a reduction of biomass, the increasing slope of the water influx reduction leads to a shift of the optimum strategy in \textit{non plastic} simulations (see figures \ref{fig:variable_strategy} \&  \ref{fig:variable_trajectories}) toward more conservative strategies. The median optimum value shifts from 0.85 to 0.75 and 0.35 in extreme conditions. This reduction of optimum toward more conservative strategies is offset in most of \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and \textit{fixed-optimisation} simulations where the median optimum value for the PAR stays above 80\%. Only a small reduction (around 25\%) of the 5th and 25th percentiles of the optimum root strategy can be observed between the extreme conditions for these two algorithms.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:variable_strategy}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Variable/var_strat_trend.pdf}
\caption[Strategy shift along a gradient of resource variability]{Median (bold line) strategy (PAR: proportion of active tissues in root) shift of the best performing species along a gradient of resource variability for four plasticity treatment.

\end{figure}

 This shift in optimum strategy can better be observed on the plan of the proportion of active tissues in roots (PAR) and root mass fraction (RMF) in figure \ref{fig:variable_trajectories} where all trajectories\sidenote{trajectory of the optimum, not of the species.} along the variability gradient are plotted. \textit{Non plastic} allocation trajectories by a linear shift toward more conservative strategies with a higher allocation to roots, while \textit{fixed-equilibrium} and \textit{fixed-optimisation} trajectories are non-linear and can be divided into two phases: (1) increase in RMF, (2) reduction of PAR. \textit{Plastic-optimisation} algorithm shows no consistent pattern in trajectories.

\caption[Best phenotypes along water resource variability gradient]{Best phenotypes along water resource variability gradient. Thinner lighter lines indicate low water variability, while the thicker lines indicate strong temporal heterogeneity.}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Diversity}

%As previously seen, plasticity can affect diversity in a drastic way, reducing the functional diversity by contracting the phenotypic space, but also increasing the potential species diversity by the same mechanism. The effect of static gain\sidenote{refers on the gain due to convergence toward a good static phenotype and no temporal changes.} and dynamic gain must be disentangled. The 


Along the gradient, the performance and the identity of the bet phenotype were greatly altered by the water variability, but the phenotypic plasticity mitigates these effects. The number of species is fairly stable for all algorithms but the \textit{non plastic} that shows an improvement in species diversity. The fixed allocation algorithms have between 15\% and 20\% of the species within the 90\%-100\% range of the maximum biomass for the conditions, while the \textit{non plastic} allocation shows this level only of the extreme variable case, but otherwise is limited to a few percents. The functional diversity is stable along the gradient and is similar for all algorithms (\textit{plastic-optimisation} algorithm being excluded)(data not shown).

%Changes in optimum, but does it affect evenness? Same pattern as before with the trade-off between species and functional diversity. What happens if you filter down stuff?





\subsection{Discussion: gradient of temporal variations}

\paragraph{Resistance to variability}

Before analysing the effect of the different plastic algorithm, the \textit{non plastic} simulations show interesting patterns. A first look at the results informs us of the relative importance of growing versus surviving. Because the mean water influx over the simulated period is conserved, an increase in the influx negative slope means that during the first half the plants have more available water, while they have less during the second half (relative to the constant influx). Thus, the decreasing biomass along the gradient suggests that this additional water (and therefore potential growth) does not compensate for a reduction in growth during the drought period. Therefore, it is more important for the plant fitness to limit losses during scarce period instead of maximizing growth during favourable periods. 

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{./2_PP/Figures/Variable/GalanthusNivalis.png}
\caption[\textit{Galanthus nivalis}]{\textit{Galanthus nivalis} is an example of species that develop early in the season to avoid competition and benefit from the high resource availability.}\label{fig:galanthus}
\end{marginfigure}

However, this conclusion should be mitigated by the fact that some reproduction strategy still can benefit from early exploitative strategies and there are not considered here because the success is measured by the biomass after 100 days. This effect can be explained by the fact that even the most exploitative species are not fully developed when the resources are the most available, therefore the potential compensation by an early growth is limited. This is the case in the context of mountain grasslands, and some specific life cycle strategies take advantage of this particularity like the \textit{galanthus} species (see figure \ref{fig:galanthus}) with early development \parencite{schroder_modelling_2014}, or development from a bulb that allows for an early and rapid growth.

% selection of more conservative species, plus reduction of the prod that shows non-compensation mech. -> best strategy during the bad period, but no
%The selection of more conservative strategy at the end of the gradient confirms the importance of maintaining growth (or reducing losses) during the period of lower water availability and demonstrates the higher resistance of the conservative strategy to the resource fluctuations.

The reduction of biomass along the gradient, even in plastic conditions, supports the idea of a lack of compensation mechanisms between favourable and unfavourable drought periods. In addition to this conclusion, the better performances of the conservative species in low water conditions relative to exploitive species (see figure \ref{fig:gradient_strat_trend}) suggests that the best strategy is determined by the optimum resource-use strategy of the most important growth period (the drought period). However, another mechanism can be involved and is relative to the capacity of the species to perform well both in conditions that suit its phenotypes and in conditions that do not suit its phenotype. In a variable environment, the phenotype does not match conditions different from its niche centre because of the optimum resource-use strategy may change, or because of the balance between root and shoot activity changes. Both can be important. As said, the former is suggested by previous results, however, under plastic allocation, the optimum resource-use strategy is maintained at high values of the proportion of active tissues. Therefore, the difference in optimum resource-use strategy along the gradient cannot explain alone why conservative strategy is better in contrasted environments. The other explaining mechanism is a better resistance to variability from conservative species, relative to exploitative. The variability in water conditions, while the light conditions are fairly constant, leads to a shift in the balance in the availability of the two resources. If the phenotype is fixed, a shift from balanced conditions (equilibrium between shoot and root is respected for the given phenotype in these conditions) to unbalanced conditions (no more equilibrium for the same given phenotype) can be seen from the plant perspective leading to a reduction of the overall gain function stronger than the actual decrease in resource, because the non limiting organ is in over-capacity. Because they have a higher resource-use efficiency (see figure \ref{fig:asymmetric_gain}), conservative species can cope with this reduction in gain due to unbalanced organ activities. Therefore, in variable conditions, the optimum strategy shifts toward conservative strategies that have the capacity to support greater exchange rate reductions and have a greater \textemph{resistance to variability}. Under plastic allocation, the equilibrium is maintained, reducing the need for a strategy resistant to resource fluctuations. This is illustrated by the figure \ref{fig:variable_trajectories} that shows along the variability gradient a direct shift toward more conservative root strategies and greater root allocation, while under plastic allocation the shift toward conservative strategies is delay for stronger availability gradient, but the RMF shows larger values (they are measured at the end of the simulation, when the water availability is reduced).\\

\textbf{The plasticity of the RMF axis allows plants to cope with resource availability and maintain exploitative strategies. These strategies are more sensitive to changes in resource levels under \textit{non plastic} allocation than the conservative species that benefit from a greater resource-use efficiency.}


%Therefore, to the given plant, the decrease in resources is stronger than the actual decrease in resources, and the optimum resource-use strategy shifts toward a more conservative strategy than a balanced phenotype would require. 

% message: it is not because the optimum change, it is because the conservative species are more resistant to variability.

%\end{figure}

\paragraph{Who benefits from the plasticity?}
% who wins -> asymmetric and impact of the identity
While the phenotypic plasticity does not provide any clear advantage to a type of species in constant conditions, in changing conditions the phenotypic plasticity benefit to the exploitative species that are able to maintain good performances in contrasted conditions (see figure \ref{fig:variable_strategy}). Because the plasticity gain is asymmetric, the phenotypic plasticity alters the identity of the community and promotes exploitative species in variable conditions while conservative species are favoured under \textit{non plastic} allocation. In a more theoretical view, the plasticity can be seen as an alteration of the strength of the stress as shaping factor of community \parencite{grime_evidence_1977}. If the plasticity allows the exploitative species to better support stress, in modelling studies that do not take into account such plasticity, the amplitude of the stress needed to see a shift in the community identity may under-estimated.

% effect on the stability of the community
This \textemph{asymmetric gain} should favour already established species as it lowers the perturbation effect of climatic fluctuations. This stability is interesting for the maintenance of the ecosystem properties and services provided by the mountain communities. It also supports the idea of a greater resistance to climatic events that are expected to be more frequent under the climate change. 

% Why is that? absolute and relative, the role of the equilibrium

\paragraph{Dynamic gain and stability}

The plasticity has also an effect on the maximum biomass as observed in the figure \ref{fig:variable_BM}. This effect is almost null in constant condition, as expected from the previous simulations, but increases with the resource variability. There is no evidence of improvement for all resource-use strategy, but because the unbalance caused by the temporal variability in resource greatly reduces the productivity, we can assume improvement of the biomass for all strategies. Therefore, the productivity between non plastic and plastic community under variable conditions should increase.

\begin{figure}\label{fig:variable_filter}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Variable/variable_filter.pdf}
\caption[Abiotic filtering in temporally variable conditions]{Conceptual representation of the abiotic filtering in variable conditions and the illustration of the dynamic gain.

The middle panel is the growth rate as a function of the phenotype for two positions in time. The bottom panel illustrates the growth curves for the different phenotypes. Two alternative position \textcolor{myOrange}{A} and \textcolor{myGreen}{B} represent a sub-optimum and the optimum position without plasticity (dashed lines). Alternative plastic trajectories are represented by continuous lines.}
\end{figure}

This is explained by the trajectories within the fitness landscape that can follow the changes in the optimum phenotype, and so present a total biomass superior to the best \textit{non plastic phenotype} (see figure \ref{fig:variable_filter}). The difference of biomass between a \textit{non plastic} phenotype and its plastic counter-part (\textit{fixed-equilibrium} or \textit{fixed-optimisation}) is call the \textemph{dynamic gain}.  This gain is not caped by the best \textit{non plastic} performance.


The overall increase in productivity, in addition to the reduction of the abiotic filtering effect, should greatly increase the competition
%Because the shift in non plastic condition is due to vulnerability, and not optimum strat during the most growing period. (there could be some compensation, leading to best exploit phen, even if conservative are indeed more perf in drought period).

% What what consequences for the productivity (cite maire)




\paragraph{About diversity}

The dynamic gain observed in temporally variable conditions has a similar effect on the abiotic filtering process than the static gain as the species are able to converge toward a moving phenotype and maintain positive growth, despite not having the best starting phenotype (see figure \ref{fig:variable}). However, in this context, this effect is even more important as it can allow species to establish in local conditions that not \textit{non plastic} species could invade. In other words, it makes some habitats viable that would not be if there was not any plasticity. This effect can only be positive of species diversity because it is a net gain with no direct effect on competition.

While the trade-off between the functional diversity and the species richness is maintained, the asymmetric gain of plasticity may allow, if the costs of plasticity are considered, levelled fitness between conservative non plastic species, and plastic exploitative species.\\ % if I can find citations for that it would be good. 



\textbf{The phenotypic plasticity in variable conditions shows similar processes that in fixed conditions. The convergence of the species toward an optimum sub-space leads to a reduction of the functional diversity but an increase of the species diversity. This reduction of the abiotic filtering should also increase the importance of the competition as a regulating process. However, it differs by an asymmetric gain that favours exploitative species, more vulnerable to changes in resource availability under \textit{non plastic} allocation. In addition to this alteration of the community identity under plastic allocation, the productivity/competition intensity at a community level would be increased by a dynamic gain that improves the performance of the best phenotypes where the static gain does not (in stable conditions). }

\end{figure}


\textbf{The phenotypic plasticity implemented in \model improves the relative performance of multiple strategies by concentrating the plant toward a subspace of higher performance for most of the plants. Convergence to a smaller subspace can be assimilated to a reduction in phenotypic diversity, but it reduces performance heterogeneity and should favour local plant diversity. However, this effect should be limited by plasticity cost. Indeed, if the growth gain due to plasticity is only static, any species with a fixed phenotype closer to the optimum than the focus species has a better growth rate and exclude the focus species.
%Meta-community diversity should, however, reduces by the reduction of potential axis for niche differentiation. Plasticity costs and limits should play a major role in the balance between these mechanisms.
 Community-level simulations are needed to further understand the cumulative role of competition, spatial and temporal variability and plasticity costs on phenotypic plasticity influence on plant community dynamics.}


\section{Other plasticity patterns, alternative implementations and stability of results}\label{section:stability}

% one type of plasticity, imagine other implementation based on plastic response pattern. 

The phenotypic plasticity implemented in the model \model is the only way of modelling plant plastic responses, inspired by the tested hypothesis of the functional equilibrium, adapted to the light and water resources. Other patterns of plastic responses can be observed, and numerous alternative implementations can be imagined to reproduce these patterns. This section puts in parallel such plastic response pattern with alternative ways of modelling the phenotypic plasticity, and conjecture on the robustness of the results described above in these new modelling approaches.


\subsection{Resource foraging and architecture plasticity}

Phenotypic plasticity in the context of plant ecology is often related to resources gathering and use-strategies. While other forms of stress can be integrated, such as the grazing or frost events, the immobile aspect of the plant life and the inherent variability of resources encourage to focus on the resources needed to the production and maintenance of organic matter. The model \model present a simplistic form to answer the changes in resource availability, relying on the hypothesis that the exchange rate is homogeneous and can be integrated at the individual scale. In case of heterogeneous resources, other modelling strategies may have better results.

\paragraph{Resource foraging}

In habitats where the abiotic stresses are low but the competition limiting, the resource foraging is a crucial mechanism to model. For example, in the context of forests, the observation of closed canopy reveals a relatively high crown plasticity leading to the incorporation of this phenomenon with techniques such as the tessellation \parencite{berger_competition_2008}. Such technique has a limited cost, and suits well tree canopies with constant resource-use strategies, especially when only one resource is spatially-modelled explicitly, as it is often the case in forest models. 
% shoot, forest

% etiolement
Nonetheless, such architectural plasticity is also observed within herbaceous species. In case of limiting light resource, the plants may adopt an etiolation strategy that aims to explore the 3D-space to find light \parencite{whippo_phototropism:_2006}. This is an extreme case of morphological plasticity when the plant is bereaved of light, that leads to extreme changes in the shoot morphology - increases of the stem and leaf lengths, decreases of the leaf area - but also in the shoot chemistry - decrease in the tissue density, reduction of the chlorophyll content. Such response of increased SLA, reduction of the RMF and of the reduction of the chlorophyll content can be observed in less extreme cases of light reduction \parencite{mitchell_intraspecific_2014}. But the noticeable aspect of the plastic response to the reduction in light availability is the strong photo-tropism of leaves \parencite{whippo_phototropism:_2006}, strongly altering the architecture of the plants.

% roots
Such architectural plasticity is also observed for roots, sensitive to nutrients and water levels. Multiple aspects of root architecture can be modelled as plastic, while the root depth is often used, the vertical root distribution can also vary \parencite{nippert_challenging_2015} as well as the horizontal distribution \parencite{maire_plasticity_2013}, with beneficial impacts on the individual and community efficiency and productivity.


\paragraph{Architecture plasticity}

% how
Despite a form of plasticity that answers changes in resource availability, the current implementation of \model is not able to reproduce such patterns. Indeed, these foraging behaviours are incompatible with \model on two major aspects. First, the morphology and chemistry axes are independent \parencite{mitchell_intraspecific_2014} while the design of \model tries to encapsulate multiple dimensions along the LES with simple allocation trade-offs. The drastic contrast in function between functional enlighten leaves that balance light capture and gas exchanges to maximise the production of organic matter, and the etiolation leaves that explore the 3D-space at low cost to find resource cannot be captured by the simple representation of the shoot, neither the objective functions that drive the plastic allocation. Second, such exploration of the space requires a spatial awareness and an architectural plasticity that cannot work with a cylinder representation of individuals. Voxel-based approaches can be used to model such plasticity \parencite{reineking_environmental_2006}, as well as the explicit representation of individual organs \parencite{yan_dynamic_2004, vos_functionalstructural_2010}. The resource availability gradient can be easily represented as attraction field constraining the development of new organs. To balance the foraging and the exchange functions of the organ, and translate this function into a organ-specific phenotype, a reference point (delimiting the two functions based on the resource availability in the organ-local-environment) can be defined either as a function of the "niche" of the species, or relatively to the other compartment activity to ensure equilibrium. This change in function must be translated into a chemical and morphological function to fully reproduce the pattern, but this step is certainly challenging won't be discussed here.

% benefits: it's cool
This kind of implementation has the ability to capture foraging behaviour in environments where the resource can be scarce and highly heterogeneous, such as the shallow soils of mountain grasslands, with high fine grain heterogeneity \parencite{reineking_environmental_2006, deleglise_heterogeneite_2011}. This spatially explicit plasticity should allow the emergence of competition patterns that cannot rise from the current implementation of the model. In addition to this emerging pattern, an organ-based plasticity should limit the phenotypic flexibility (see discussion in the subsection \ref{section:calibration}) and increase the phenotypic inertia, leading to stronger and more stable responses.

On the other hand, the implementation represents a technical challenge as it greatly increases the complexity of the agent, the decision rules and the overall computation cost of simulations. In the context of community dynamics, it seems such complexity would be more detrimental than beneficial. This complexity is also higher due to the increase in species-specific parameters to drive this architectural plasticity. It seems that progress needs to be done before considering such development at the community scale. However, imagining such an implementation lets us conjecture the effects of an alternative plasticity of the system and estimate the relative robustness of the results described above. This stability of the pattern emerging from the current implementation is discussed in the following paragraph of this subsection.

\subsection{Stress-based alternative implementations and robust observations}\label{subsection:alternative}

\paragraph{Stress-based plasticity}

Aside from the way plants alter their phenotype to respond to estimated heterogeneity (spatial and temporal) in resource availability, the plasticity can also differ on how the estimation is built and modified during the time, and how it affects the plastic response. The results relative to the parameter filtering process (subsection \ref{section:calibration}) did not present the expected results in term of the amplitude of the response of the RSR to the watering treatment. Multiple factors can explain this behaviour, and multiple solutions have been mentioned. One of them is the stress-based plasticity that consists of model plastic behaviour as responses to stress, and to change the idea of memory into a sensitivity variable. This idea develops the concepts established by the biological understanding of the plasticity of the article from \citet{crisp_reconsidering_2016}. They present the molecular mechanisms that can be involved in the memory or recovery of a stress event, \textit{i.e.} how the plant capture the change in condition and how this information is stored (or not). As illustrated in the figure \ref{fig:stress_memory}, after a stress the plant can recover and return to the pre-stress expression (return to the default phenotype) \parencite{liu_biomass_2004}, or maintain the level of expression (stress response phenotype) \parencite{peterson_growth_1982}. If it recovers, it can maintain the memory of the stress and have an amplified response or reset and ignore the event, leading to a similar response during the second stress.
% what? and how? stress, response, reset, memory, recovery



\begin{figure}\label{fig:stress_memory}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Concepts/stress_memory.pdf}
\caption[Stress memory and recovery]{Stress memory and recovery. A theoretical example of memory formation, where up to thousands of stress-inducible transcripts (green lines) respond to the initial stress, concurrently with an accumulation of signalling molecules and the release of repressive chromatin (orange lines). Upon reexposure to a second stress, persistent signalling molecules and a retained accessible conformation of chromatin (solid lines) allow an enhanced stress response. The recovery period is a critical window where plant memory can be consolidated or resetting (dashed lines) can occur. \textit{Modified from \citet{crisp_reconsidering_2016}, see the paper for more details}.}
\end{figure}

Such mechanism would stabilise the plastic responses in case of non-recovery, or increase the inertia and the amplitude of the response with the transcriptional memory. The stress can be quantified easily, leading to a proportional response of the phenotype to compensate for the stress. In the context of the functional equilibrium, the deficit in the activity in one organ can be compensated by its increase in exchange area. Because the response is related to the stress and not a gain function, it does not have to follow the same constraints as the initial strategy as it is in \model, offering a response decorrelated from the resource-use strategies. When the response can be achieved in multiple ways (increase in allocation or morphological change), a decision must be developed. It seems that this functioning allows for the integration of multiple stress factors, however, difficulties may emerge if they alter the same organ. Cases of additive stress (water and nutrient) can be observed in empirical studies \parencite{fort_root_2015}, suggesting that an additional approach to this problem could work. Multiple stresses integration \parencite{pierik_art_2014} was one of the objectives of the model \model and it was integrated but not tested.

The implementation of the stress-based plasticity seems to have the potential to better mimic the plastic behaviour of plants, with recovery and amplified responses, reduced constraints on the axes of the plastic response and greater response variability. However, it comes with an additional level of complexity with more required species and stress-specific traits, and stress-specific decision rules.


% benefits stable phens, take into account vulnerability, not only optimum
% multiple stresses, different stress level (already possible, even if only 1 tau value in this implementation of MG

% drawbacks: hard to integrate into a global gain function, and to determine the value of composite traits, multiple species-specific parameters -> calibration is harder (but can start with common parameters)

\paragraph{Reaction norms}

% what and how?
As mentioned, the implementation of stress-based plasticity requires new decision rules to drive the trait response to specific stress as there are no longer controlled by an integrative gain function. Reaction norms used to characterise the plastic response of traits along a gradient constitute the perfect tool to drive such plasticity. An ambitious implementation that would distinguish the plastic responses of different species could maintain a general pattern with a shared formula of the reaction norm, but with different parameters between species.

% benefits
Because the reaction norm approach does not give an optimum phenotype, but a variation of the current one, default phenotypes must be defined. Considering that these default phenotypes are viable, they should benefit from a more stable plasticity. Indeed, the plasticity based on a gain function targets one optimum phenotype considering the estimation of conditions at a given time. Therefore, it does not consider neither the probability of having wrong information and as a consequence, a non adapted phenotype nor the temporal variability that would require changes in phenotype not possible in a given context or time-frame. On the other hand, reaction norms are able (because they are less constrained) to produce plastic responses that are more stable (even if less performing in stable estimated conditions).

% drawbacks

\paragraph{Resistance or avoidance}

% observed in many cases
The reaction norms, as opposed to the integrative shared gain function, allows a great heterogeneity in plasticity. This plasticity seems necessary when the plastic responses of multiple species along multiple gradients are observed. Indeed, different species may respond differently to specific treatments \parencite{ grassein_plant_2010, freschet_plasticity_2013}, or even different populations \parencite{frei_plastic_2014}, or along a large gradient \parencite{kichenin_contrasting_2013}.

% resistance vs avoidance: the stress degree and initial strategies
While the implementation of species-specific reaction norms allows contrasted responses, these plastic responses need to make sense in an ecological perspective. In other words, the alternative changes in phenotypes need to lead to a greater (or more stable) fitness. Therefore, in face of a stress, to maintain positive fitness ones can either try to avoid the stress or try to resist to the stress. It is often hard to tell which strategy is the best (and it may depend on the overall resource-use strategy of the species), therefore they coexist and be observed between different species in the same conditions \parencite{perez-ramos_tradeoffs_2013}, or alternate if the conditions offer sufficient information to determine which strategy is the better \parencite{heger_light_2016}. Under stress-based plasticity, the form and parameters of the reaction norms can control the balance between the two. Under architectural plasticity, the direction of the response to the stress can also allow these contrasting responses to coexist (reduction of the non-limiting-organ exchange area, or an increase of the limiting-organ exchange area).

\paragraph{Robust observations?}

Having described roughly two alternative/extended implementations of the phenotypic plasticity, we can try to estimate if the results observed with the current implementation would be reproduced under these alternative models. This should give us an idea of how these patterns can generalise.

In summary, two alternative implementations are proposed:
\begin{itemize}
\item I1: the architectural plasticity, exchange area regulation based on measure difference in activity;
\item I2: the stress-based plasticity with species-specific additive reaction norms.
\end{itemize}

The main effect of plasticity is increasing the niche width and the niche overlap. Also, without plasticity costs, the plasticity tends to reduce the fitness differences between species. The architectural plasticity should give similar responses to changes in resource availability, even if there is optimisation function. Because the response is driven by the relative activity of the organs, equilibrium should be maintained in most cases. Because all traits respond to modify the exchange area of the two organs, the risk of lag should be limited. But, this can also be translated into rapid exhaustion as discussed for the plasticity implemented in \model. Both forms of gain should be reproduced in this the implementation I1. In addition, the architectural plasticity provides a solution for a more efficient foraging that can further increase the potential productivity, the competition intensity \parencite{maire_plasticity_2013} and even lead to differentiation \parencite{roscher_contrasting_2015}.

The alternative implementation I2 should also provide niche widening and fitness difference reduction, but the reaction norms should avoid exhaustion mechanisms, especially if they authorise a convenient shift between stress avoidance to stress resistance strategy under increasing stress intensity. The reaction norm implementation is closer to natural behaviour by an implementation inspired by molecular mechanisms rather than evolutionary hypothesis. Therefore the chances of maladaptive plasticity to emerge are greater because there are no constraints for a coordinated plant functioning. This would be particularly the case if the reaction norm forms and parameters are defined thanks to evolutionary approaches in conditions different from the tested conditions (due to global change for example). Because these two forms of plasticity should prevent unbalanced plant functioning, the asymmetry in the gain in variable conditions should be preserved. \\

\textbf{The current implementation present the simple and coherent framework that allow to simply explore broad effects of the plasticity on the community. The implementation I1 offers a great tool to explore the effect of the plasticity on the fine scale and how these fine-scale interactions may shape the community functional diversity. The implementation I2 can better be used to explore the dynamics of plasticity strategies. Overall the two alternative implementations should present similar broad effects on the community properties, and the conclusions of this work can be generalised. All implementations present interesting particularities that can be used to explore different questions. }
