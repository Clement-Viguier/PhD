%\section{Introduction}

\begin{fullwidth}
The objective of this chapter is to develop the core concepts of the model, introduced in previous chapter, and explain the structure and design choices made during the model development. The first part focuses on the general context of alpine grasslands and some coexistence mechanisms at stake. The following part details the definition of the strategy space and the modelling of phenotypic plasticity, while introducing the key concepts of species memory and individual experience. Finally, the last part is a detailed description of the model following Grimm recommendations \cite{grimm_standard_2006}.

\section{The scale of alpine grasslands}

\paragraph{The scale}
The scale is a determinant variable in the quantification of mechanisms that structure ecological communities \cite{bello_hierarchical_2013}, and therefor in modelling approaches. It is chosen based on structures that the modeller intends to explore, and determine the upper limit of mechanisms the model can reproduce. Large scales will favour geo-climatic and dispersal effects \cite{kleidon_global_2000} while small scales will focus on direct plant interactions processes or resource heterogeneity \cite{ soussana_gemini:_2012, maire_plasticity_2013, taubert_modelling_2014}. This is true for spatial scale, but also temporal scales. Because of ...reasons... , spatial and temporal scales are often correlated.

\paragraph{The resolution} The resolution is also determined by processes of interest and the scale of the model. 

\paragraph{Complexity: scale and resolution}

\section{Resources: light and water}
As mentioned in the previous chapter, resource fluctuations, heterogeneity and competition are important factors for coexistence. Unlike animals, plant mainly compete for the same resources: light, water and nutrients. Light is the source of energy that allow the transformation of inorganic carbon into organic matter through photosynthesis. Water has multiple function in plants: transport, structural support, and oxygen supply for photosynthesis. Nutrients are used in construction of cells and cell walls, and especially the production of proteins that act as cell machinery.

\subsection{The strategy space in \model}

\paragraph{What is a strategy space}
In an ecological agent-based simulation model a species will be defined by its values for the species specific parameters. They can be estimated from experimental data \cite{taubert_modelling_2014, maire_traits_2009,lohier_explaining_2014} or be picked from a strategy axis \cite{reineking_environmental_2006, kleidon_global_2000} composing a strategy space \cite{westoby_leaf-height-seed_1998}. The diversity of the species pool will depend on the number of values for each of these specific parameters, or traits, and the number of these traits. Each trait increasing the dimension of the strategy space \cite{laughlin_intrinsic_2014}. The ambition of this model being to simulated rich plant communities, the definition of these axis is crucial. Trade-offs between traits are excellent applicants for these specific parameters as they reduce the dimensionality of phenotypes to a small number of dimensions \cite{wright_worldwide_2004, diaz_global_2016, reich_world-wide_2014} while keeping the information of traits needed to describe the plant functioning. Trade-offs emerge from ecological and physical or biological constrains, by considering these constrains Darwinian demons are avoided.\\

While considering too many axis does not improve community description, a certain number is needed to have strategic diversity \cite{laughlin_intrinsic_2014}. This is intuitively explained by the fact that each trade-off is closely related to a particular aspect of fitness or mechanism for coexistence (\textit{e.g.} reproduction, competitve ability, resistance to resource shortage, predation, etc.). In this model, multiple aspects of plant life are represented: germination with the germination rate for storage effect \cite{chesson_general_2000, adler_climate_2006}, dispersion with seed mass \cite{westoby_leaf-height-seed_1998} or tissue construction cost \cite{reich_leaf_1992, wright_worldwide_2004, reich_world-wide_2014}. Main components of plant growth and life history are covered by such trade-offs and driven by mechanisms shared by all vegetation systems. Because of that, the model has a great potential of genericity and diversity. It can be easily adapted to other plant communities with specific calibration, and extended with couples of biological process and differenciation axis (\textit{e.g.} root herbivory and associated resistance carbon pool). The the trade-offs used in the model are detailed in the model description below \sidenote{see serction \ref{chapter:model-description}.}. These axis should, in such models, be independent, (\textit{i.e.} it is physically and biologically possible for a plant to take any position in the space drawn by two given axis) and result from physical or biological laws (ensuring that impossible strategies are indeed excluded from the model). First, it is a condition for parsimony of the model. Second and more interesting reason is that any trade-off emerging from the model should have an ecological interpretation \cite{maire_disentangling_2013}. \\
 

One way of constraining plant strategies to certain axis is to consider allocation trade-offs \cite{kleidon_global_2000, reineking_environmental_2006}. An allocation trade-off is the translation of the mass conservation rule that prevents the allocation of biomass to distinct carbon pools. If biological functions are related to organic matter pools (photosynthesis to leaves, water and nutrient uptake to roots), then the sum of biomass to invest in each carbon pool (therefore in each function) cannot exceed the total available biomass: leaving the plant with a choice on the balance between the different functions. Allocation trade-offs have the advantage to be easily implemented and be intuitive. By design, a partitioning factor value corresponds to a position on the related strategic axis. In \model, five main trade-offs are captured by allocation trade-off: (1) development vs reproduction: partitioning factor between reproduction and maintenance of vegetative tissues (when plant is mature), (2)  persistence vs dispersion: partitioning of reproduction biomass between persistence (storage) and production of new propagules (seed/clone production), (3)aboveground vs belowground competition: investment between shoot and root, \cite{kleidon_global_2000, reineking_environmental_2006, taubert_modelling_2014}(4) slow vs fast: construction cost trade-offs between active and structural tissues in both shoot and root and (5) growth vs resistance: partitioning between stored biomass and frost resistance carbohydrates \cite{cai_changes_2004}. This last trade-off can be extended to other carbon pools of specific resistances, for example to herbivory. Modification of these coefficient during life history is a way to introduce plasticity in the model. The rules driving such changes for some of this partitioning parameters are described in the following section.\\


One of these trade-offs, (4), is key and related the construction cost of organs (independently leaves and roots). Highlighted at global scale and for leaves, the Leaf Economic Spectrum \cite{wright_worldwide_2004} draws an strategic differentiation axis from conservative slow species and exploitive fast species. The construction cost has long been identify as a factor of strategic differentiation in plant communities\cite{westoby_leaf-height-seed_1998}. This strategic axis, being related to many functional traits: SLA, LDMC, LNC, leaf longevity, Amass, etc.\cite{wright_worldwide_2004} is of crucial importance. First, these traits are closely related to the characterisation of plant communities and the assessment of services \cite{grime_benefits_1998}. Second strong links and correlations can be made between these soft traits physiological traits \cite{craine_functional_2002, reich_variation_2003, wright_worlwide_2004}. Finally, a species resource use strategy is closely related to its responses and vulnerability to changing conditions \cite{poorter_causes_2009, dwyer_specific_2014, deleglise_drought-induced_2015}. The traits related to this trade-off play a major role both in individual growth and physiology, and in community services and response to gradient. Therefore it is essential to the model. Questioning the underlying mechanisms for such strong trade-off is necessary to implement satisfying representation in the model.\\

\textbf{Change this: may be start with shipley results, then composite stuff. Question: should it be here, or in the following part ?}

These trade-offs between highly productive tissues with low construction cost and short lifespan called exploitative, and more conservative strategy with longer lifespan but lower productivity are mainly observed thanks to soft traits such as SLA for LNC \cite{wright_worldwide_2004}. Mechanistic model require traits related to physiology and organ performance \cite{soussana_gemini:_2012, lohier_explaining_2014}, but link can generally be done between these traits and soft traits. However traits such as SRL or SLA are composite traits emerging from different organ properties \cite{ryser_importance_1996,john_anatomical_2017}, where tissue density and organ thickness are the main determinants. "\textit{A necessary trade-off between allocation to structural tissues versus liquid phase processes}" has been identified by Shipley et al. \cite{shipley_fundamental_2006} as one of the two main factors for the leaf economic spectrum to emerge. Such allocation trade-off can indeed explain differences in construction cost as the liquid phase corresponding to the "active" part of plant tissue, the cell content, have much lower dry volumetric mass than its "structural" counterpart, the cell-wall. Also active tissues containing the protein machinery for photosynthesis and water absorption, a higher proportion of high protein concentration tissue would be correlated to higher nitrogen concentration in the organ on the "fast-slow" spectrum, along with a higher mass-based photosynthetic rate \cite{reich_world-wide_2014}. On the other end, the structural tissues give the organ a higher lifespan \cite{mediavilla_internal_2001, ryser_importance_1996} that compensate for lower productivity \cite{westoby_time_2000}. Such trade-off can be apply to both shoot and roots \cite{craine_functional_2002, tjoelker_linking_2005, reich_world-wide_2014}. From that, the decomposition of organs between active and structural tissues constitutes a strong basis to model construction cost trade-offs as the main parts of the global strategy space.\\

The Similar axis of differentitaion has been demonstrated for roots \cite{ reich_world-wide_2014, tjoelker_linking_2015}. The necessity for independent similar axis for leaves and root can be discussed with respect to coordination between shoot and root activities. Because perfect equilibrium cannot be guaranteed in all conditions, strict coordination cannot taken as a principle for the reduction of strategy space. Moreover, empirical results suggest small deviations from coordination are common \cite{freschet_explaining_2015}. The leaf economic spectrum being conserved at the intra-specific level \cite{ hu_novel_2015} is another reason to include such trade-of as it would be a good basis for phenotypic plasticity \cite{freschet_plasticity_2013}.\\


%Take home message ####################################
\textbf{The use of allocation trade-offs allows the construction of a generic multi-dimensional strategy space where a high diversity of species can potentially coexist. Because this space is based on physic laws, it ensures the non existence of Darwinian demons and does not limit the species or individual plants to tested parameters and strategies. To be complete the link between carbon pool allocation and physiology must be determined within the respect of similar biological or physical laws.}

\section{Craft a trade-off: active and structural tissues}

Allocation trade-offs offer great flexibility and are easily understood and implemented. However, when they control the value of traits (SLA or SRL) involved in multiple processes, a balance must be found to avoid that: (1) one process is ignored because has a low relative importance on fitness (becoming useless to the model), (2) the effects of processes involved show strong response curves to the allocation and there is only one global\sidenote{I use the term global here to designate the multidimensional space draw by the axis of interest and other variables play a role in involved process (e.g. resource availability, temperature etc...).} optimum. The idea behind a trade-off is that multiple positions are viable in different conditions or in association with other strategies. The leaf-economic spectrum, in addition to rely on the active-structural tissue trade-off, also requires "\textit{an evolutionary trade-off
between leaf photosynthetic rates, construction costs, and leaf longevity}". This trade-off is explore in this section of the document.\\

In the framework of the model, plants share the same global parameters, and the maximum photosynthetic rate should be the same. Because photosynthesis relies on the exchange of gases ($CO_2$, $O_2$ and $H_2O$) and the interception of light, it is related to exchange area. Considering one shared parameter for maximum area-based potential exchange rate satisfy both the need for a shared parameter and a way for plant to vary their mass based exchange rate by changing its proportion of active tissues. This is in agreement with the LES that describe strong relationship between mass based traits and limited ones for area-based variables \cite{wright_worldwide_2004}, and explain the first part of the trade-off between photosynthetic rate and construction cost. The second part is the relationship with the longevity. The longevity is often correlated to SLA in empirical studies, however this is mainly explained by differences in tissue density and toughness than in thickness (other component of SLA) \cite{}. For this reason we can directly link the leaf longevity to active tissue proportion. Respiration is also increased by the increase of proportion of photosynthetic tissues \cite{kleidon, reich}. We have now a trade-off between a gain function (exchange area gain by changes in densities) and a cost function (tissue turn over and respiration). This should be enough to explain different strategies \cite{westoby}. However the model need internal limits to avoid the gain function to lead to only active tissue organ (or only structural). These limits are required to allow individuals or species to change position along these axis (plasticity or strategic shift). The convex shape of gain function in association with a minimal cost (minimum turn-over cost above maximum potential gain) is enough to limit the allocation to structural tissues only. To avoid allocation to only active tissue, that would correspond to an organ made of protoplasts, the cost function need higher than the potential gain. To acheive that an ... function is chosen. This choice ensure that the potential gain function has an optimum different from the borders. \textbf{(see figure)}.\\

\paragraph{gain as function of conditions}
Active got closer to optimum, but less active and positive gain in more conditions. Can I demonstrate this with formulas ? (gain = function(condition))
\\

The potential gain is not only function of active tissue proportion, but also depends on resource availability. Changes in resource level imply changes in slope of gain function and a shift of the organ optimum for tissue allocation. This shift make more conservative strategies more interesting when resources are scarce, while more exploitative allocation strategies are better for high resource availability. This link between optimum allocation and resource level could be used to define the best phenotype according to experience conditions, but the organ strategy cannot be disconnected from the whole plant strategy and allocation.\\

The phenotype (within the subspace of vegetative allocation) depends both on the individual efficiency of organs and the balance between shoot and root activity. This balance, often used to model plant plastic allocation and considered between light and nitrogen \cite{lohier, soussana}. In the context of mountain grasslands and global change, the water... The integration of nitrogen as a limiting solution is discussed in latter chapter. The balance between shoot and root activity being key in overall performance, the root shoot ratio (RSR) will be determined as a function of estimated availability.

\chapter{Modelling phenotypic plasticity}


\section{Plasticity as a strategy: between species memory and individual experience}

\subsection{Concept of active plasticity as a strategy}
\paragraph{Decomposition of plastic response}
Active plastic response is highly integrated and involve a lot of regulatory processes. It is impossible to represent all regulatory processes involved in an APR (because of our lack of knowledge and their complexicity). Alternatively, the concept of \textit{integrated response} can be conceptualised. It supposes link, or coordination, between the experienced conditions and the phenotypic response. This can be translated, in the model framework, by the existence of explicit link between a representation of external conditions and a phenotype matching this conditions: the \textemph{allocation rule}\sidenote{the use of the word \textit{allocation} is justified here since the phenotypic plasticity in \model is reduced to changes in allocation.}. Another key work is \textit{anticipatory}. It supposes that the plant knows, or at least have an idea of the future conditions. This is really the point of an active plastic response: change the phenotype to better match future conditions. A representation of future is also called a \textemph{projection}. The projection and the allocation rule together form the active plastic response.\\
If allocation rule is not obvious and is discussed latter\sidenote{see paragraph \ref{section:allocation-rule}}, the idea of projection is fairly intuitive. The projection will correspond to a value for a given metric that represent the external conditions. It can be resource availability level, temperature, herbivory risk, etc... If such metrics can be given at the community scale, it make sense to use plant centred measure of these variables for two reasons: (1) take into account the spatial heterogeneity, (2) plant experience of conditions is necessarily egocentric. The details on how experienced conditions are interpreted by plants in \model is described in section \ref{chapter:model-description}.

\paragraph{Control of plasticity}
Active plasticity is now represented by a projection and allocation rule. However, how a species can control the whole process is unclear. In theory both projection and allocation rule can species specific. In nature plants generally have structurally similar regulatory processes\sidenote{see box \ref{box:molecular-basis}.} and response to external stimuli is translated (and stored temporarly) thanks to the accumulation of chemical compounds\cite{need-references}. These mechanisms suggest that, while the allocation rules are mainly  shared, individuals vary on the information level (i.e. concentration of phyto-hormones), or in the context of the model: plant vary in projection. This control  of active plasticity is supported by the model design. The number of rules that can drive the allocation is reduced and discrete, while the projection is multi-dimensional (one dimension per external variable considered), continuous and high flexible with a reduce number of parameters\sidenote{details in paragraph \textit{estimation of conditions} in section \ref{chapter:model-description}.}.
For this reason \textemph{projection} is chosen to be the \textemph{controlling factor} of active plasticity, while the allocation rule is \textemph{fixed} and \textemph{shared} between all species. Therefore an individual with fixed projection wont be actively plastic, despite the fact that it could express apparent plasticity because of external factors: reduced resource availability, grazing, frost damage, etc... The model has now a concept for active plastic response\sidenote{In the rest of the document terms \textit{plasticity} or \textit{phenotypic plasticity} will refer to \textit{active plastic response}.} controlled by the projection of external condition. The next question that need to be answered is: how do species differ in their plastic response ?\\


\paragraph{Species specific plasticity}
In \model, the projection of external conditions is the mean for plants to alter their phenotype in response to changes in experienced conditions. Since the allocation (or driving) rule is shared by all plants, if the projection of external conditions is also shared by all plants, then is the response still active plasticity ? The first intuitive answer is \textit{yes}, since the conceptual framework is respected and plants would react to changes in conditions that would affect the projection. But, such response would be equivalent to a direct external control of the climate on the phenotype. In such case, species would not have control on how the phenotype varies, that would be fully controlled by shared projection and shared allocation rule. This is passice plasticity. To have proper active plasticity, the species need to be able to \textemph{regulate} the plastic response. If species can regulate plastic response thanks to species specific parameters, plasticity becomes a \textemph{strategy}. This is in agreement with Bradshaw vision of phenotypic plasticity as a trait, or a character, subject to selection and evolutionary processes\cite{bradshaw_evolutionary_1965, bradshaw_unravelling_2006}. How do species regulate plastic response to make it a strategy?\\

\textbf{Plasticity}: expected environment -> phenotype, here phneotype is equivalent to biomass partitioning, that means expected environement -> allocation coefficients. Then memory -> expectations -> allocation. Because low dimensions, and we want diversity, and the link between memory and allocation might not be a function (one memroy give exactly one optimum allocation), in the model this relationship is not verified. Species specfic traits are used to allow for different strategies to be associated to a same memory (different plants won't have the same strat, despite sharing the projection)\\
%Once the plasticity is introduced, talk about the memory. Now you can also talk about the mapping/consistency between both and the difficulties to use both.


\subsection{Projection of external conditions: between species memory and individual experience}

\paragraph{Build a projection}
The projection is the way plant controls phenotypic plasticity. A projection is an idea of the future based on available information and understanding of phenomenon. Ones could discuss what is the understanding of the climate by plants, while others can focus on how to represent such understanding and state that fine molecular regulatory processes can reproduce and store such information. The focus is on the construction of the projection with respect to the different sources of information a plant has: (1) its experience of climate and external factors, and (2) its ancestors memory\sidenote{see paragraph \ref{subsection:memory}.}.\\
While, for any given individual plant, the experience of external conditions varies in time, the memory stays fixed. There is a clear contrast between variable experience of conditions and the fixed species memory. A way to represent different strategies and the level of control the plant apply on projection is to vary, between species, the relative weight of species memory against individual perception. This species specific parameter, the \textemph{confidence in species memory}, sets the \textemph{stability} of the projection with respect to individual experience. The capacity to adapt the phenotype to changing conditions is directly linked to the projection changes. High confidence in species memory translates in low amplitude of projection variations, and though in low active plasticity.\\
The calculation of projected resource availability levels, or temperatures, are detailed in dedicated paragraph of the model description. The key message is that the species has control on plasticity with both its confidence in species memory, and the said memory that alters the projection. The relative impact of memory and confidence is described in figure \ref{fig:memory-confidence}.

% The species specific memory of external condition has been described\sidenote{paragraph \ref{subsection:memory}} as a way to match certain traits (mainly root:shoot ratio) with external conditions. The memory is a metric of resource availability that is used to partly (potentially entirely) determine the phenotype of plants.

\paragraph{The paradox of plasticity}

While the representation of plasticity as a strategy increases both model species diversity and potential  diversity of response \cite{ ryser_consequences_2000, kichenin_contrasting_2013}, plasticity itself may reduce plasticity. Indeed, plasticity lead to a change in phenotype in response to condition changes, while this phenotypic change is unlikly to be identical, its direction will probably be similar. Few mechanisms can prevent convergence of phenotype besides the diversity in memory and plasitcity: (1) changes in competitve hierarchy may lead to differences in individual experience of conditions, (2) specificity of the external driver, e.g. selective herbivory of more digest species, (3) relative position of the optimum phenotype.\\



Or can a plant be plastic and unique ? The paradox of plasticity and diversity.\\
Plastic will neceseraly reduce the space (as there is convergence, unless different strategies of adaptation).\\

 Because the plasticity is a strategy and not a default behaviour, its effects on individual performance have to be tested. But it also opens a lot of interesting questions around the costs and benefits of plasticity, and the co-selection with the resource use strategy.\\
Moreover this particular implementation of plasticity limits risks of convergence while allowing plants to evolve in the strategy space defined earlier.

\section{Driving rules of allocation}\label{section:allocation-rule}

Allocation rules is determinant in the model behaviour as it is shared by all species, and link the projection of conditions with the phenotype. Multiple options are possible to drive plasticity, but they can be divided in two main categories: (1) determining, (2) directive. Function from the first category fully determine the phenotype (within the plastic strategy space), while functions from the latter group direct the phenotype toward a sub-space and other parameters are needed to determine the exact new phenotype.\\
The two type of rules have different strengths and weaknesses that are detailed in table \ref{table:allocation-rule}

\textbf{... few words on the space ?\\
The driving rule of plasticity defines whether or not the choice of the  phenotype is fully determined by the projection of external conditions or constrained by some species specific parameters. The effect of this balance between projection and parameters is crucial in the model behaviour. In any case the projection is the main control on individual plastic response to change in conditions, offering possibilities to modulate individual plasticity despite a shared mechanism.}
