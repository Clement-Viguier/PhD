\section{Introduction}
\section{Strategy space and allocation pools}
Leaf economic spectrum + Shipley + Poorter

\The multiple axis of \model. Reproduction, leaf, roots, geometry, frost. Not all combinations work, but there are probably co-selection: tool to explore ecological trade-offs (different from structural trade-offs).\\
Also, not coexistence of all selection (see Barabas nature letter), but increasing the number of dimensions should allow more combinaison of trait. But, may be hard to ensure "neutrality" as you increase the number of dimensions, you may discover strong optima and therefore deccrease realised diversity despite larger potential diversity. (probably not at the good place since it is really more discussion than results).

\subsection{Allocation or anatomy: a choice to make}
what is SLA and SRL: cost of exchange area: tissue density, tissue thickness. Poorter 2009, grace2017, Katabuchi 2017, de la riva 2016\\
THere is not only coordination -> part of RSR is explained by SRL:SLA\cite{freschet_explaining_2015}. Multiple source of information (memory) that affects these traits: composite traits that affect multiple fitness dimension -> memory not only for climate. -> but also coordination. More tight trade-off for root with smaller changes in SRL and more changes in RMF, the opposite for SLA. Need for a model that allow such asymmetry.

\section{Model overview}
\paragraph{pseudo-code and routine}
\paragraph{allocation}
mechanism and stochasticity\\
5 types of allocation\\

\section{Plasticity: between species memory and individual experience}

\subsection{Concepts}
\paragraph{Memory} Genetic memory (see Sonia Sultan book for references). Selection and evolutionary processes.
\paragraph{Equilibrium and efficiency}
\paragraph{Optimum, strategy and memory} There might be optimum. But not easy to compute, especially when you consider more complex cost and interactions. Depend on different efficiencies and equilibrium... Also, you may want to avoid efficient by risky strategies (if you wrong, or if there is a quick shift). Need for strategic traits to drive allocation more than memory.\\
Ok but what happen with optimisation allocation ? -> need the strategy to be tightly linked to memory. But that part has requirements: memory is a reliable source for strategy. Ultimately the resource availability is only one (ok, maybe two) dimension to phenotype optimisation. This strategy trait is necessary as other aspects of fitness are ignore (temperature implemented but not tested, grazzing vulnerability, frost damade, WUE, CO2 etc...) If you multiply mechanisms affecting the fitness you complexify the fitness landscape and allow for multiple strategies to be explored. Otherwise you must aartifically constraint. \\

\indent \textbf{This is crucial to discuss this important aspect of strategic differenciation emerging for processes and how plant change strategy as the projection of environment evolves. Memory then plays more a role of sensitivity (with tau).}\\
But for the moment the partial implementation of that through the artificial but meant to disappear default strategy is making analysis and assumptions difficult. Ok, but how do you treat it ? 

 equilibrium, resource use, resource availability, condition estimation
\paragraph{Condition estimation}
Important role of condition estimation. Perception mechanisms. (cost). Difference between plasticity and acclimation and epigenetics. 

\subsection{Implementation}
Why the use of a sampling method: complex effect of allocation and complex allocation system that is meant to be extended. Some results on the stability of phenotypes. How sampling method can drive the allocation.


\subsection{comparison of different algorithms}
full plasticity : freschet 2015 in poorter \& Ryser 2015
the two sides of the performance/fitness: equilibrium and tissue efficiency\\
age vs biomass.\\
How the different algorithms react and how does they affect performance with tau = 1, and tau =0 ?\\
Convergence of phenotypes.

\section{From individual performance to community dynamics}
Mostly hypothesis and discussion on underlying mechanisms that drive the community dynamics and rarely discussed within theoretical models.

\subsection{The convergence of phenotypes: what effect on coexistence ?}


\subsection{Who benefit from this plasticity: what does that mean for new communities ?}

\subsection{Better performance, better resistance ?}
lead to paper 2.

\subsection{From invasion resistance to tipping point}
Hyp: better resistance, intraspecific variability vs species turn-over.\\

Can does that lead to tipping point ? should discuss that after the second paper).
