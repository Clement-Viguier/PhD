\chapter{The effect of phenotypic plasticity on plant community dynamics}
Hypothesis on the cumulative effect on niche and interactions.

\section{Individual resistance and resilience against drought events}
Amplitude and length of the event :\\
- severity effect reduced by lower tau ?\\
- resistance versus resilience: H0: conservative strategy have higher resistance, H1 : low tau allows for re-equilibrium and increase resistance (low amplitude and long length. H2: high tau allow to avoid dead-end situation during short severe drought (high resilience)
\section{Community response to drought event}
coexistence effect vs resistance/resilience effect\\
uniform vs heterogenous (plasticity wise) community response
H1:
