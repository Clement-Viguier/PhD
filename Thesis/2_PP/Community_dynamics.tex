%Hypothesis on the cumulative effect on niche and interactions.

%\section{Individual resistance and resilience against drought events}
%Amplitude and length of the event :\\
%- severity effect reduced by lower tau ?\\
%- resistance versus resilience: H0: conservative strategy have higher resistance, H1 : low tau allows for re-equilibrium and increase resistance (low amplitude and long length. H2: high tau allow to avoid dead-end situation during short severe drought (high resilience)
%\section{Community response to drought event}
%coexistence effect vs resistance/resilience effect\\
%uniform vs heterogenous (plasticity wise) community response
%H1:

\chapter{Community level parametrisation}

\section{Method}

\paragraph{Field calibration}
New random parameters sets (with no species specific parameters) for population dynamics and competition specific parameters (see table ...). Shared parameters previously selected were used.
Sequence of around 300 year for each site. Parameters were selected by...


\paragraph{Field data}
Field data has been collected between years 201 .. and 201 by Claire Deleglise and al. ().

\paragraph{Weather data}
Weather data has be computed by the MeteoFrance model SAFRAN by ... using GPS coordinates and slope, azimuth and horizon computed from a "MNT". These parameters were also used by the model CROCUS to compute snow accumulation and melting. These high frequency data (resolution under 1h) have been average daily and used to compute input variables for \model.

\section{Results}

Simulations done. Need to illustrate the results.\\

\paragraph{Effect of parameters}
On stability and on diversity (functional and species)\\
Random forest approaches like sensitivity analysis at individual scale.

\paragraph{Ecological trade-off ?}
Is there a selection of some parameters ? Are there ecological trade-off (resource use strategy and reproduction) emerging from the model ?

\chapter{Plasticity: impact on species fitness and diversity}

\section{Method}

\section{Results}

Need to run the simulations. Script is almost ready, parameters are filtered from previous step.

\paragraph{General behavior}
\subsection{Plasticity: a winning strategy ?}
Are plastic species more selected than the other ? Probably a bell-shape curves

\subsection{Effect on coexistence}
