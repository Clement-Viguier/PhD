\section{Craft a trade-of and phenotypic map}
Can memory be related to strategy and active/structural ratios in shoot and roots ?

\section{Niche response}
Obj1: understand how resource use mechanisms and allocation algorithms shape the environmental potential niche in the context of the model.\\
H1: strategy and memory affect niche in two ways if we suppose they are independent: shape and position. Strategy mostly affect shape (width and height) while memory (and so root:shoot ratio) affect mostly position.\\
H1': there is strong link between strategy and memory in the case of optimisation allocation that increase niche height and might reduce its width.\\
Obj2: understand the role of plasticity on the niche and if the effect in the same for all strategies/memories.\\
H2: the plasticity increase niche width but not height (as phenotype is optimum at the center of the niche where memory match the resource availability).

Stability and efficiency trade-off. Niche heigh and width and relationship with the strategy. How does plasticity affect that ? Does it increase the height and widen niches ? What does that mean for coexistence ?\\
Hopefully higher niche would go with unstable niche.

\section{Transitivity and competition}
1 vs 1 interactions\\
Is the resource competition transitive ? How does niche widening impact that, does plasticty change competition interaction. Is it related to the trait distance ? (don't think so)
