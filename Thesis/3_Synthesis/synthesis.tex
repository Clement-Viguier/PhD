\section{Phenotypic plasticity...}

\section{The limit of the species.}

In this work, but also because of the improvement of molecular biology, and the deeper and deeper dive ecology is doing within individual, the limits of species are fuzzy (started with trait and the introduction of continuity). At some point, there will be a need for a way to go back from the a space of numerous continuous dimensions to the species. Also, understanding species as evolving 3D objects, where the different aspects of intra-specific variations play different shaping roles.
