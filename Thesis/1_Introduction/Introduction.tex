\chapter{Mountain grasslands}
\fwnewthought{Mountain grasslands have an unique beauty drawn by the diversity of flowers colours, the strong contrast between the luxurious green vegetation and the roughness of the naked rocks, and the feeling that living in such places, at the edge of living conditions, is a fight worth fighting. I could illustrate this beauty with thousands pictures and words, and it would certainly convince you that these ecosystems worth spending time studying them to better understand and protect them. I could also describe their role in the economy of alpine regions, currently subject of great modification, and greater to come. But you would not see these rich systems as I see them: as an intricate network of interaction living creatures, with their own characteristics, strategy and experience, forming a dynamic system... Capturing this beauty is one challenge of this modelling PhD.\\
I must now give you an overview on the mountain grasslands}


%\section{Photograph of mountain grasslands}
The idea is to go from context, to services to ecology. At the entd of this part, it is obvious that ecosystem services can be derived from traits and that we need tools for prediction of MG dynamics.

\chapter{Modelling ecological systems}
The message here should be that: we know how to model vegetation systems, but we need finer resolution (from species and com, to traits, to individual responses) and bigger (higher number of species) scale -> generic framework and individual response.\\
Based on two particular similar models: taubert, and Lohier.

\section{Models as understanding and testing tools}

\begin{quote}
"Physicien de la biologie"
\end{quote}
Justify the modelling approach - what's a model ? simplification of reality\\
Long subject refer to models in ecosystem sciences. Different classes of model, and different objectives. Mechanistic models: understanding and testing hypothesis.\\
Model as understanding tools: how does modelling help us understanding the system we are modelling.\\
The need for mechanistic model and emergent properties of models. Process-based models vs statistical model (what happen outside the data (example of flickering tails of regression models), similar to bayesian approach, the model is constrained by our understanding of processes.) \\
mechanistic models: risks of lack of mechanisms, complex calibration, lot of parameters. Statistical model have the advantage of parcymony: minimum number of parameters to reproduce a pattern.

\section{Modelling plant communities}

\subsection{Different levels of modelling: from communities to individuals}
community approaches, CWM to importance of individuals.\\


\subsection{Processes}

\subsection{Agent-based models}

Review of existing models (grasslands and forest)\\
Comparison of two existing models\\
How to build aroung/from that.\\


\section{Modelling coexistence}
Message: modelling coexistence is a challenge because 1) do not know/understand all mechanisms, 2) challenging to incorporate enough mechanisms, 3) costly computation and data wise. -> need for more generic and complete (multiple mechanisms approaches.

\subsection{What is diversity and why model it?}

On why model coxistence: better understanding of mechanisms, tool to evaluate and predict changes in coexistence.

still a trade-off with scale.
