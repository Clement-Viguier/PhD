This chapter is dedicated to the review of literature and aims to introduce the concepts and hypotheses used and interrogated in following chapters. A link between properties of the community and the ecosystem services is first drawn, then I examine the use of functional traits to represent plants, plant functioning, and communities. Finally, the impact of intra-specific variability, in particular phenotypic plasticity, on community properties is interrogated.

While this thesis is a modelling thesis, it is not a modelling textbook, and rather than exhaustive description of the different types of models the focus will be given to selected modelling examples close to the context of this work.

\section{The different facets of plant communities: from processes to services}



%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{From community description to ecosystem services}

Mountain grasslands provide numerous ecosystem services 

ecosystem services depends on abiotic, but also biotic factors and properties. 


\textbf{The evaluation of ecosystem services relies on a precise description of the ecosystem abiotic and biotic properties. The plant community is the most dynamic and complex driver of ecosystem services, but direct links can be drawn between the fine description of the community and the ecosystem services. Defining and understanding the main variables that capture those links is necessary to efficiently predict changes in ecosystem services levels.}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The facets of plant communities}

\textbf{Plant communities are complex interconnected systems. In order to evaluate ecosystem services, they can be summarised by three main types of variables that capture different dimensions of such systems: the diversity, the productivity and the identity. These dimensions can be studied independently or jointly and give different information on secondary properties and provided services.}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{From processes to properties}

\subsection{Filtering processes: from potential to realised niche}

\paragraph{Perspectives}

\paragraph{Abiotic filtering}

\paragraph{Biotic filtering}

Abiotic drivers main tnhing at global scale... Then interactions and competition.

\textbf{The concept of ecological niche serves as a great tool for theoretical research on coexistence. It encompasses in a convenient way both abiotic and biotic filters of one species distribution. The Hutchitonian view of the niche also captures the multidimensionality of persistence and reproduction. However, niche concept does not make explicit the mechanisms that maintain coexistence.}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The complexity of coexistence}

\paragraph{The question of coexistence}
If ones want to better understand and predict dynamics of complex systems, they first need to understand how such complex is assembled. If it is easy to observe diverse ecosystems (from bacteria, to plants, insects or algea), it is challenging to determine the processes that 1) group the entities together (in time and space), 2) maintain an apparent stability in the group composition (at least at a certain spatial and temporal scale). This set of processes are called the assembly rules. Different type of processes are at stake to maintain a community and the general filters are illustrated in the figure \ref{fig:assembly_rules}. ...\\
We can image imagine biotic filtering as an physical filter, the same way abiotic filter is often illustrated, but this image does not translate the dynamic and complex nature of underlying processes. Biotic filtering emerge as the result of all the interactions between the entities that make it through the other filters. And how these interactions, direct or indirect, play together to see the stability of the diversity.\\
Plankton paradox in homogeneous system, where abiotic and dispersion should have little role into maintenance of species diversity.\\
																			
Focus on interaction: chesson modern coexistence theory.\\

Chesson vs Tilman. 
Chesson focuses on interaction and 2 by species, give central idea of stabilizing vs fitness difference.\\
Tilman focuses more on resources, how the use and impact on resources affect competition and can enable conexistence, but limited coexistence according to this criterion: plankton paradox. No heterogeneity, no temporal dynamics\\

Other things being equal hypothesis (in models at least) does not allow the full diversity to emerge.\\

\parencite{clark_resolving_2007}

%\textbf{One mechanisms alone seems to not be enough to explain fantastic diversity observed in natural ecosystems. However there are multiple theoretical mechanisms that support species diversity and that should taken into account in community models: diversity of resources, spatial and temporal variability, frequency dependent effects, etc...}


\textbf{Plant community require strong coexistence mechanisms to maintain species richness. Single theories fail to predict high diversity observed in plant communities such as natural mountain grasslands. However, high dimension coexistence processes and complexity seems to be an answer to the biodiversity paradox. In addition to niche based coexistence processes, other mechanisms that promote coexistence must be considered.}

\textbf{Spatial and temporal heterogeneity play a major role in coexistence maintenance by creating various opportunity, or niches, in a given ecosystem. Other forms of temporal variations support stable coexistence.}
 
 % conclusion of the section/chapter:
 \textbf{The evaluation of services relies on a good representation of the plant community and its essential properties. To represent complex interacting systems like vegetation communities, descriptive approaches are not sufficient and driving processes must be considered. Explicit heterogeneity and dynamics of the resources is key to understand and model filtering processes and community dynamics. Modelling both community properties and resource dynamics require understanding of plant functioning and diverse growth strategies.}

Same resources: even more difficult to understand coexistence. Must have differences on how they gather and use these resources. Species is not a handy tool to describe differences in functioning and strategies. Shift in paradigm needed.

\textbf{Traits are good proxy for competitive interaction and fitness differences. .. a bit more complex. If the interaction is transitive, a strong asymmetric pattern can be observed between interaction effects and trait differences, while symmetric interaction reveal niche differentiation processes. Despite these observed relationship, alternative mechanistic solutions must be adopted to capture the multi-dimensional and context-dependent nature of plant interactions.}


\textbf{The paradigm shift toward functional ecology allowed the shift from discrete to continuous representation of species. This change makes easier the representation and study of plant communities, especially along conditions or management gradient. Traits are also used to study plant interactions. However, the need for multiple traits to capture plant niche differences or similar response patterns of multiple traits suggest underlying structure within trait assemblage. Understanding this structure and how it relates to community dynamics external drivers is crucial in the representation of diverse communities.} 

%Despite the advantages of functional traits, close comparisons and links with theoretical approaches should be used carefully, and underlying assumptions should be interrogated.

\subsection{Trade-offs: capture constraints on species differences}

Diversity of mech: diveristy of strategies. more or less independent.\\

\textbf{Trait-based ecology rapidly lead to the observation of trait correlations and trait syndromes between plants. These axes of differentiation emerge from processes that constraint plant strategies. Better characterisation of these constraint should allow a better representation of plant functional diversity.}

\subsection{Strategy-spaces made of trade-offs}

\textbf{The multiplicity of processes shaping vegetation systems leads to similar constrained diversity in plant strategies. These strategies are captured in a strategy space drawn by independent trade-offs tightly related to functional traits. These functional trade-offs have great potential in the representation of a functioning plant diversity.}

\subsection{How models inform us on properties and dynamics}

\textbf{The use of strategy spaces in models allow the representation of high diversity in a common plant functioning framework requiring limited number of parameters. Such approaches are very useful to follow the dynamics of communities in a mechanistic framework. New vegetation models take advantage of the power of traits and trade-offs to model species characteristics and dynamics, therefore cannot traits be also used to describe the assemblage of these species? }

\textbf{According to the Mass Ratio Hypothesis, some properties of the community directly scale to the characteristics of the most abundant species. In this hypothesis, the functional identity, defined by functional trait values, has more importance than the species identity. Community Weighted Mean measures generalise this hypothesis using mean species trait values. While these tools can link community composition to ecosystem properties and services, they require precise measures of plant functional traits to be reliable.}

In addition to facilitate the study of the effect of abiotic conditions and biotic interaction, traits can be used to describe the community and its main properties to evaluate ecosystem services.}

\textbf{However, the accumulation of trait measurements useful for the study of gradient response patterns and community structure, also reveals the variable nature of traits.}

\textbf{After the emergence of trait-based ecology and its high potential, recent focus on intra-specific trait variability question the strength of such approaches. While it does not negate numerous conclusion from previous work, the effect of intra-specific variability on community dynamics processes must be interogated, and underlying mechanisms investigated.}

\textbf{The intra-specific variability has been observed to be an important part of community functional diversity, but also a way the community respond to changes in conditions. In addition to the empirical evidence of this importance, theoretical approaches support contrasting effects of such variations on coexistence mechanisms, evolutionary processes and community responses to climate event or invasion. It is crucial to disentangle different sources of intra-specific variability in order to their understand potential effect on ecosystem dynamics.}

What are the possible effects? probably it does not affect interaction like \parencite{hart_how_2016} supposes (even if they talk about variations, their conclusions may not be extendable to plastic variations). May change a lot the balance between abiotic filtering and biotic filtering. 

-- go to indivdual mechanisms, evolution could tackle genetic variations, physiology and ecology on ontogeny, and evolution and ecology on phenotypic plasticity


\textbf{Simple approaches to intra-specific variation constitute an improvement over mean approaches as they highlight processes ignored until now. However such approaches overlook the structure of the variability and underlying processes, leading to simplistic representations and potentially misinterpret the role and effect of this variability.}

% section/chapter conclusion

\textbf{%As ecology shifted from species to traits syndromes, it seems that it needs to go from syndromes to distributions and drivers.
Ecology shifted from species to traits syndromes with great success, but the intra-specific variability constitutes a great challenge for generalisation of observed patterns. By overlooking the processes that structure intra-specific variations, we might loose capacity to properly interpret the role of variability and refine our understanding of community functioning. The complexity of living communities requires to go further down and consider the individual scale. This is made possible by the accumulation of more and more numerous and detailed data, the improvement of statistical and new simulation tools. The question of the sources and drivers of intra-specific functional variability seems crucial to rise to the challenge it issues.}

\section{Phenotypic plasticity: a specific case of intra-specific variability}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The different sources of intra-specific variability}


\textbf{Intra-specific variability can be decomposed in two main types: genetic variability that seems to be closer to random processes envisioned in simple models of intra-specific variability, and phenotypic plasticity that specifically links variations of phenotype to differences in external conditions. These mechanisms of variations are under the control of both evolutionary and molecular processes, that need to be better understood to be disentangled and to better predict their effects on community dynamics.}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{What is phenotypic plasticity?}

\paragraph{Forms of plasticity}
phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a species to produce individuals with the same genotype but different phenotypes. This difference in phenotype should be an active process, not the results of direct alteration of the phenotype by external factors without changes in internal functioning. This change in internal functioning process has the objective \sidenote{in the sense it has been selected because it provides this capacity} to match the phenotype with expected future conditions to maximise the individual fitness. The expression "expected future conditions" is key here, as it is this projection that drives the plasticity.
%Confusion, phenotypic plasticity is particular phenomenon, driven ...\\

\textit{Active plasticity is used for predominantly anticipatory, and often highly integrated, phenotypic changes in response to some environmental cue or signal, and reflect modifications of developmental pathways and regulatory genes.} Forsman - 2014\\


Passive plasticity, on the other hand, may stem from direct environmental influences on chemical, physiological and developmental processes, and is generally not considered anticipatory, but a mere consequence of the environment, such as stunted growth owing to low resource levels.\\


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./2_PP/Figures/Concepts/genotype_to_phenotype.pdf}
  \caption[Decomposition of plastic response]{Decomposition of phenotypic plasticity as a step between the genotype and the fitness. Phenotypic plasticity is the effect of environment on the link between genotype and phenotype. Plasticity can itself be decomposed in active plastic response that change the internal status of the individual (under genetic control) and passive response that result from inevitable effect of environment of the traits on the individual.}
  \label{fg:PCA_calibration}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Molecular basis}

\textbf{Active phenotypic plasticity is an integrative process at the scale of the individual that aims for an improvement of plant fitness by the adjustment of its morphology according to environmental cues. Defining the extend and the rules of such mechanism is not an easy task that might depend on the context and the framework used.}

\textbf{New simulations tools for understanding community dynamics should try to both include multiple coexistence mechanisms and plant strategies, and focus on individual level mechanisms of competition, growth and survival. This can only be achieved an a constraint high dimensional strategy space based on physical and biological trade-offs. Individual level modelling allows the integration of multiple sources of intra-specific variability: genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity being driven by the perception of environment, it cannot be simply described by normal random distribution and should receive more attention. This focus is particularly important considering both the lack of understanding of this phenomena and the consequences for plant communities.  }

%\chapter{On coexistence and diversity}
%
%\section{Diversity and coexistence mechanisms}\label{sec:coexistence}
%
%Diversity of natural systems have long been a subject of admiration but also a mystery to the scientific community. The extraordinary multitude of species and individuals living at the same time, in the same space, is hard to reproduce and to explain. This is particularly true in plankton communities where the resources are limited to few nutrients (nitrate, phosphates) and light. Early coexistence theories, like the competitive exclusion principle that predicts that the number of coexisting species at equilibrium can at most be equal to the number of limiting resources, fail to explain such variety. This gap between empirical observation of high diversity in different systems and at different scales, and the lack of theoretical explanation was called the \textit{plankton paradox}. This paradox has now received multiples answers \textbf{NEED REFS}\sidenote{discussed in later in subsection \ref{ssec:div-mech}.}, but diversity and coexistence mechanisms are still investigated \parencite{falster_plant:_2016}. This illustrates our will to understand these mechanisms, but why are we still struggling with questions that animated ecologist decades ago? and why are we still interested by these questions? It is hard to answer the first interrogation, but the diversity of the interactions within such systems and the diversity and variability of external drivers shaping them are the main factors. That also explains partly the second question, and why scientists explore the genetic diversity of gut bacteria, or the phylogenetic diversity of phytoplankton in lakes, or the diversity of plants species from tropical forest of Brazil to snowy slopes of Alps. But besides the curiosity of scientists, studying the machinery behind the functioning the natural communities is essential if we want to understand and predict how they can evolve under the pressure of changing drivers, and how they can be managed. The following paragraphs attempt to explain the value of diversity, and so why we have to predict and manage it at best, and where is our current understanding of underlying mechanisms.\\

View such traits as mono dimensional is dangerous as it simplify a lot (and I might have fallen within this trap). Having low level traits that define the overall strategy (and not how to achieve it) should help to have a more systemic view (good term here ? view of the system with all its parts) and better understand the rules that drive the development. But they also imply the need for new mechanisms to link such traits and strategies to actual, measurable traits that define the phenotype as we see it (at the level of interaction or services profides). \\
%Opportunity to emphasis the fact (a simple scheme should help here) that apparent traits are usefull (and measurable) to define the current effect on the environment (and so interactions between plants) and on provided services, but they are difficult to use to predict the dynamic of individuals and communities (precisely because they are changing and composit traits that respond to the environment).

%Message: modelling coexistence is a challenge because 1) do not know/understand all mechanisms, 2) challenging to incorporate enough mechanisms, 3) costly computation and data wise. -> need for more generic and complete (multiple mechanisms approaches.
%
%\subsection{What is diversity and why model it?}
%
%On why model coxistence: better understanding of mechanisms, tool to evaluate and predict changes in coexistence.
