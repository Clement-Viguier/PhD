    description={Change in phenotype controlled by internal regulation processes. Opposed to passive response. \textit{i.e.} change in SLA when light is limiting is an active plastic response.},

    name=adaptive plasticity,
    description={Active plastic response that lead to an increase in fitness. A plastic response may be adaptive despite an apparent reduction of fitness, indeed the adaptive response may mitigate a larger reduction in absence of plastic response.},

{
    name=allocation rule,
    description={The allocation rule is the set of rules that determine the target phenotype of a plant considering its actual phenotype, the biomass available and the projection of external conditions. It can be decomposed in two main parts: the plastic dimensions, and the fitness proxy function (or gain function). Allocation rule is also designated as allocation algorithm, plasticity rule or plasticity algorithm.}
