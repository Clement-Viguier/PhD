    description={The allocation rule is the set of rules that determine the target phenotype of a plant considering its actual phenotype, the biomass available and the projection of external conditions. It can be decomposed in two main parts: the plastic dimensions, and the fitness proxy function (or gain function). Allocation rule is also designated as allocation algorithm, plasticity rule or plasticity algorithm.}
