\subsection{The value of ecosystems: from properties to services}

\paragraph{A new logic}
Everyone has a particular relationship with nature. The vision we put behind this word depends on the way we experienced nature, it can be temperate or tropical forests, mountain rivers or cliffs on the ocean littoral, bird songs or wind between stones. Anyone that shares one of these visions wants to preserve natural systems. But facing this emotional perception and inner desire to see these ecosystems be preserved, there are other forces that push in opposite direction. The reduction of biodiversity is increasing at dangerous rates, the deforestation threaten the largest forest systems, insects are less and less presents and animals are repelled to fragmented and diminishing habitats. Logics, other than emotional attachment and will to protect nature, impact all natural systems around the world because they are driven by other interests. To be protected, the natural systems needed a way to be integrated within these strong driving logics. The notion of \textemph{ecosystem services} was developed by \cite{costanza_value_1997} to capture the value of \textemph{ecosystems}. It encompasses the benefits humans extract from ecosystems. It enables a categorisation of services and their quantification (that can go to the monetisation), and therefore allows them to be taken into consideration in global logic of capital, investment and value.


\paragraph{Services}
The notion of ecosystem services aims to capture the value of ecosystem, but what is this value? In other word, what benefit do nature provide us? If ones could be tempted to answer that the value of an ecosystem cannot and/or should not be measured, it is clear that all ecosystems do not benefit to human in the same way, and that these differences could be quantified. Facing the diversity of ecosystems, and the diversity of services they provide, we can try to develop a short answer for the object of study to this document: mountain grasslands.

The term \textemph{mountain grasslands} designates, in this document, all grasslands, below and above the treeline, that have short growing seasons delimited by snow covered periods and experience high variations in temperature and water availability. This term is intentionally generic as the scope of this work is relatively broad and theoretical.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./1_Introduction/graphics/services.pdf}
  \caption[Forms of plasticity in models]{Three forms of plasticity in models. }
  \label{fig:services}
\end{figure}

Mountain grasslands provide numerous services, that can be divided in multiple categories such as provision, cultural and regulating services (see figure \ref{fig:services}). Provision services are related to the quantity and quality of primary resources the grasslands provide. Fodder production and quality are the main measures of provision services. Other services can be included in this category: diversity of flowers and phenology for flower production for instance. Productivity is also interesting to assess carbon capture, a regulating service. Soil nutrient availability and water filtering are other regulating services impacted by the identity and diversity of species populating mountain grasslands. Finally, cultural services, related to tourism activity and landscape appeal are also related to grasslands species diversity.


In case of terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation cover is often central because of: it role of primary production, and the fact that vegetation community informs a lot on the properties of the abiotic and biotic conditions. Moreover, a most of studies on services from terrestrial ecosystem are interested in plants and soil invertebrate \cite{de_bello_towards_2010}, revealing the importance of vegetation in the provision of ecosystem services. In addition, in alpine habitats plant communities are susceptible to be the first impacted by global change because they cannot escape changes in conditions and are the target of management practices linked to fodder productions. All these arguments support the interest of studying the vegetation dynamics for the assessment of ecosystem services.


\paragraph{Properties}
The ecosystem services are tightly related to the \textemph{ecosystem properties} (as illustrated in figures \ref{fig:services})\parencite{lavorel_predicting_2002, diaz_incorporating_2007} that can be extracted from the description of the grassland communities. Ecosystem properties are features of the community that characterise it and arise from the characteristics of all parts of  the system or how they combine. The main properties of a plant community are capture in the following concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textemph{identity}: the identity of the community refers to the dominant species (or directly its characteristics) of the community that transfers its traits to the whole community. It can also refer to mean traits (with community weighted mean measures) of a community. In this document, identity will often be used to talk about the resource use strategy (more or less exploitative). While this notion can encompass multiple traits and measures, it is practical to use one term to identify components of the community description that can be attributed to a species\sidenote{in opposition to variables that are related to a system, \textit{e.g.} diversity cannot be expressed for a species alone};
\item \textemph{diversity}: diversity plays a large role in the provision of multiple services, and is related to other properties of the community. Diversity can be expressed in term of species richness or functional diversity\sidenote{each measure depending on the functional space that is considered}, and by a wide range of indexes that are not discussed here. Despite a lot of nuances between these notions, they are often tightly correlated and diversity will be discussed in term of number of species or functional volume in the rest of this document.
\item \textemph{productivity}: productivity captures the capacity of the system to produce organic matter in a given timespan. It is a ambiguous term as it can refer to the abiotic environment, to a species or a community property or even to a service. I will try to limit its use to the species or community relative vegetative biomass in a given condition.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{From community description to ecosystem services: the facets of the community}

%Ecosystem services are various. Some of them can be easily assess (e.g. fooder production and quality), while others are more subjective (cultural or recreational services) or hard to measure (carbon sequestration, water purification etc...). But all of them rely on a good description of the system, even though this description do not have to be complete as certain aspect of an ecosystem might not be relevant to all provided services.


Linking ecosystem services to ecosystem properties is essential both for the understanding of processes controlling these services, and for an easier quantification of such services. This is particularly important for the prediction of services levels to plan management practices in the context of global change. Some ecosystem services are here linked to the main community properties as illustrated in figure  \ref{fig:properties}. Because services are hard to assess, ones can take advantage of this link and assess levels of ecosystems services thanks to a detailed description of the community; of both its structure and properties. The structure is defined by the relative abundance of the different species of the community, and properties result from the combination of the structure and the specific characteristics of present species. Multiple drivers affect the relative abundance and characteristics of a given species, from abiotic filtering processes to biotic interactions. So, ecosystem services also largely depend on abiotic factors \parencite{lavorel_predicting_2002}. Therefore, there is a tight link between drivers, community structure and properties, and ecosystem services (see figure \ref{fig:drivers}) that can be exploited to predict changes in ecosystem services \parencite{lamarque_plant_2014}. 


\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{./1_Introduction/graphics/drivers_properties_services_m.pdf}
  \caption[Drivers to services]{Link between abiotic drivers, community properties and ecosystem services.}
  \label{fig:drivers}
\end{marginfigure}

%The assessment of ecosystem services relies on a detailed characterisation of the community structure and properties. The knowledge of species characteristics and relative abundance allows the computation of summary variables that characterise the plant community. Long history of plant study and description gives us good knowledge of benefit provided by specific species. 

%

%Need of mechanisms to produce dynamics and give properties.

%\textbf{The complexity of plant community dynamics requires mechanistic approaches to understand and predict system properties in new, extreme, and variable conditions. }


\textbf{The evaluation of ecosystem services relies on a precise description of the ecosystem abiotic and biotic properties. In mountain ecosystems, the plant community is the most dynamic and complex driver of ecosystem services, but direct links can be drawn between the fine description of the community and the ecosystem services. Understanding and prediction the main variables dynamics that capture those links is necessary to efficiently predict changes in ecosystem services levels.}
\textbf{Plant communities are complex interconnected systems. In order to evaluate ecosystem services, they can be summarised by three main types of variables that capture different dimensions of such systems: the diversity, the productivity and the identity. But grassland communities are natural systems driven by environmental variables, and changes in these drivers can lead  to changes in services because of this link.}



\subsection{Global change: what changes and what consequences}

Mountain grasslands are maintained by strong climatic constraints that limit growth rate and lifeforms  \parencite{koorner_alpine_2003}, but also frequent grazing or cutting perturbation regimes that strongly limit the growth woody species and favour low stature species or rapid growth herbs \parencite{diaz_plant_2007}. But these drivers are changing at alarming rates with negative consequences on levels of ecosystem services \cite{schroter_ecosystem_2005}. Moreover, mountain grasslands are suspected to be very vulnerable \parencite{schroter_ecosystem_2005, engler_21st_2011} due to higher variations in water availability regimes and specific warming processes \parencite{mountain_research_initiative_edw_working_group_elevation-dependent_2015}, stronger isolation (island effect due to rise in temperature) and reduction of the grazing pressure.

\paragraph{Climate change}

The rise of carbon dioxide in atmosphere due to human activities has a large impact on climate. The constant increase in mean temperature is the most known and easily observable phenomenon (see figure \ref{fig:climate}. But mountain grasslands will also suffer from more frequent and severe drought event, but also precipitation events \parencite{beniston_climate_1997, solomon_climate_2007, intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2014}. They will also experience longer growth seasons and stronger invasive pressure from alien species and species from lower altitude.


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./1_Introduction/graphics/ipcc_scenarios.png}
  \caption[IPCC scenarios for global mean temperature]{Historical models and projection scenarios for global mean temperature from \cite{solomon_climate_2007} }
  \label{fig:climate}
\end{figure}

%The changes in snowmelt, season legnth and drought event will certainly increase the range of conditions alpine plants will experience.
In this context, the aptitude to plants to adapt to such changes and to cope with new competitors, no more filtered out by climatic conditions, will greatly determine the response of alpine communities \parencite{alexander_novel_2015}.

\paragraph{Land-use mutations}

In addition to changes in climate, land use is also modified.  Land-use, mowing or grazing in alpine grasslands, is a great filter for slow growing perennial species that try to accumulate biomass over multiple season. Because of such assymetric effects, land-use acts as a strong driver and can cause mountain grasslands communities to shift along service gradients \parencite{schirpke_multiple_2012}. Land-use abandonment is suspected to greatly impact the invasion dynamics as it removes the presure of biomass removal \parencite{carboni_simulating_2017}. 

\textbf{ Global change is a source of considerable changes, both in mean regimes, but also frequency and amplitude of climatic events. In addition to changes in climatic environment and resource availability, mutation of management of mountain grasslands will also affect community dynamics and particularly competition hierarchy. These modifications of strong drivers will have large effects of plant communities, and therefore their attributes and services they provide.}

\textbf{Mountain grasslands provide numerous services, that can be assessed thanks to the main attributes of the plant community. But global change threats these systems, and as consequence, the ecosystem services we take benefit of. We need tools to anticipate the effects of global change on these service and eventually adapt the management of mountain grasslands.}

%\section{Community dynamics: complexity emerging from parts and the role of phenotypic plasticity}
%title too vague to bring meaning, should put both parts together.
\section{The need for new mechanistic models}


\subsection{The limit of classic patterns}
\paragraph{A new world}

The world is changing at a fast rate \parencite{butchart_global_2010, intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2014}, but most importantly in ways never experienced by living species in recent history. So, anticipating the effects of new environmental conditions on vegetation community cannot be built on the observation of previous or existing states. Extrapolation of complex system behaviour is generally not a good predictor of its actual behaviour. The complexity of the prediction goes beyond the multiplicity of dimensions impacted by global change (rising mean temperature, frequency and amplitude of drought events, reduction of cutting frequency or grazing abandonment, etc...), as the drivers often interact, synergise or negate themselves. 

 \paragraph{Find balance}
 
 
 %community responses: different processes (recruitment, growth, plasticity etc...) \& levels (indiv, pop, metacommunity)
 
 To answer this challenge, large scale experiments are conduced such as Cedar Creek experiment in the United-States, or JENA experiment in Germany. These experiments give high value experimental data for various conditions and a variety of species, where interactions can be studied as well as management effects. Transplant experiments are also conduced to investigate the effects of temperature rise on the productivity, diversity and identity of the community (exemple for SLA response \cite{scheepens_genotypic_2010}, or see \cite{debouk_functional_2015} for an increase in productivity and decrease in diversity, as well as a shift toward more acquisitive species).
 
 But these common garden or transplant experiments also show contrasting response, that can come from opposite responses between intra-specific level and inter-pseicifc level \parencite{jung_intraspecific_2014}, between low and high elevation (changes in identity and contrasting effect in diversity between altitudes, observation data in \cite{rosbakh_elevation_2014}) or between effects (see effect of warming and carbon dioxide on phenology in \cite{reyes-fox_five_2016}).
 
 To accurately predict the future dynamics of grasslands communities, we need to be able to find the balance between dominant effects, and eventually identify the interactions. For such complexity, empirical studies provide required and fundamental knowledges of processes and basic differences between effects, but no consensus can be made \parencite{merila_climate_2014} and new approaches need to used.
 
 An additional argument for the use of alternative approaches is the uncertainty around the climatic scenarios (see figure \ref{fig:climate}). Indeed, the future of the planet atmosphere, and by consequence climate, is mainly depending on how we are capable of changing our dependency to fossil energy \parencite{intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2014}. The will to adjust management scenarios to the future of vegetation community \parencite{schipe_multiple_2012} also require extensive experiementation \parencite{rodriguez_lingra-cc:_1999, martin_simulations_2012, deleglise_drought-induced_2015}.

This description can then be used to assess the levels of ecosystem services through statistical models, to evaluate climatic scenarios or alternative land-use practices.}
  \label{fig:drivers2services}
\end{figure*}

Mechanistic approaches allow to better link drivers with community dynamics. This link can then be used to assess the level of ecosystem services as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:drivers2services}.

%niche vs process: stronger effects predicted by niche based because no plasticity or local adaptation \cite{morin_comparing_2009}



\subsection{When phenotypic plasticity makes things complicated}

Within the context of climate change, the ability of species to adapt has a great influence on the response of the community. Indeed, the capacity of species to adjust to variations in drivers, via genetic variability and mutations, or thanks to plastic mechanisms, will certainly buffer the response of community to changes in climate or land-use. \cite{morin_comparing_2009} highlight stronger responses to climate change from vegetation communities within niche-based distribution models than within process-based models that capture adaptation mechanisms. More mechanistic process should be include in these approaches \parencite{evans_toward_2016} to take into account adaptation mechanisms and interactions between species \parencite{gilman_framework_2010}. Plasticity can also changes the competion intensity that increases negative effects of climate change  \parencite{hanel_phenotypic_2015}, while it can in other cases shift interactions from competition to facilitation  \cite{callaway_phenotypic_2003}.

Phenotypic plasticity add another level of complexity to the dynamic of communities and the interacting drivers. Statistical or expert based prediction cannot handle such complexity and mechanistic approaches have great potential to model complex systems.
%The question of adaptation is closely related to intra-specific variations as intra-specific variation, whether genetic or plastic, are often justified by adaptation mechanisms (selection or adaptive plasticity).


%plus ignored effects of intra-specific variations: additional level of response: amplification or mitigations, driver dependencies?


\subsection{The rise of individual-based approaches}


\textemph{Individual-based-models} (IMBs) let the complex behaviours of systems made of numerous interacting agents emerge from individual functioning. This type of modelling is extremely well adapted to the modelling of plant communities as we have a fairly good understanding of plant functioning and parameters are relatively easy to measure. The dynamics of essential resources is also relatively easy to compute. Yet, this apparent simplicity is relative (to animal modelling for example) and numerous models have been developed with various simplification hypothesis. Most of these hypothesis deal with the essential resources: light in often ignored in grasslands, while forest models focus on this aspect of resource competition. These hypothesis are most of the time justified, and the choice depends on the focus of the modelling exercise, and the importance of the given variables for the dynamics of the system.

\paragraph{Between climate and land-use}
These models are used to investigate the effect of climate change in the sudy of \cite{rodriguez_lingra-cc:_1999} with the model LINGRA-CC and show an increase in productivity. But the link to land-use practices is always questioned, and in this example the increase in productivity allows a higher cutting frequency. Alternative scenarios are also explore in other grassland models \cite{taubert_review_2012, taubert_modelling_2014, maire_plasticity_2013, maire_trade-off_2009}. Forest modelling present also numerous implementations of individual based models (see \cite{ falster_plant:_2016, marechaux_individual-based_2017} for recent forest model examples).

Other models based on processes can be used to study long terms dynamics in the context of climate change in mountain ecosystems. It can be to study patterns of diveristy \parencite{boulangeat_fate-hd_2014} or the impact of evolutionary processes on adaptation to climate change \parencite{cotto_dynamic_2017}.

\subsection{Gaps to fill}

A wide range of models have been developed to better understand biological processes involved in plant growth and population dynamics and the impact of climate change and land-use on these dynamics. They spread from organ-based models to functional types approaches. As the scale increases, the resolution diminishes and the verticality of processes is rarely taken into consideration. This is rarely a problem in stable conditions, because the lower levels are implicitly integrated in the grain of larger processes (like the leaf gaz exchanges regulation processes are ignored at the scale of the population). But two aspects can limit such simplification: (1) if the process is ignored instead of being integrated in higher level function (\textit{e.g.}: stomatal regulation is often not modelled because it is assumed that it is correlated to photosynthetic activity, either because it is limiting the photosynthesis when the vapour pressure deficit is high, or it is down-regulated to avoid water loss when photosynthesis is limited by other factors). However, phenotypic plasticity is often ignored but not translated into the hypothesis of the model. Moreover variables that are directly impacted by this process are explicitly represented (unlike stomatal conductance with stomatal regulation processes) leading to a misrepresentation of these variables (especially root:shoot ration (RSR) or strategic traits like SLA). (2) if the non modelled process has great impact on the dynamic of the system. 

\paragraph{Dichotomy between models}
Among models that target grasslands ecosystems (or more specifically) there is a dichotomy between growth models that are mainly interested in individual processes and species dynamics \cite{soussana_gemini:_2012, taubert_modelling_2014, lohier_analyse_2016}, and models interested in species level processes and community dynamics \parencite{boulangeat_fate-dh_2014, cotto_dynamic_2017}. The former focus on individual growth of a limited number of species. They take into account fine scale resource dynamics and interactions driven by explicit strategies and precise plant functioning. These models are on the side of the spectrum of development model that often focus on a single species. Productivity of the system is often the primary concern and questions relative to the management of these system are priviledged over questions concerning climate change (but see \cite{rodriguez_lingra-cc:_1999}, but still with the perspective of productivity). The latter are more interested in larger scale dynamics driven by the climate and evolutionary processes. The questions interrogated with these models are therefore more often relative to climate change and adaptive dynamics of the communities and the effects on community diversity and identity. These models are closer to DGVMs despite finer scale interactions. This dichotomy highlight the lack of integrative models that support community dynamics at long time scale with modelling of processes at the individual scale, based on explicit resource dynamics. The explicit modelling of the link between plant strategies, plant functioning, resource dynamics and plant growth allows a solid integration of plant interaction and external drivers (via the effect of resource dynamics and plant growth). Moreover, phenotypic plasticity can be integrated at the plant level, while its complex effects are emergent. Finally, considering the growth of individuals, the strategies of species and the dynamics of the population is required to build predict of all facets of mountain grasslands communities (diversity, productivity and identity) that can integrate both management practices and climate scenarios.

\paragraph{Where is the diversity}
Because models have often practicality objectives, it is easier to develop model that can be calibrated with species specific empirical data. They can also be calibrated with bayesian procedures and pattern-based approaches \cite{hartig_statistical_2011}. As a consequence these models often integrate a limited number of species or functional types. This requirement of calibration limits the number of species simulated. To model diverse communities and evolutionary processes, this species diversity is required and generic framework must be adopted to avoid the calibration of individual species. Such diversity is observed in DGVMs that integrate trade-offs and multiple strategic axis \parencite{kleidon_global_20000, pavlick_jena_2013}.

\paragraph{Building bridges}
Mechanistic models are great tools and can be used to explore the uncertain future of mountain grasslands ecosystems. Bridges between individual-centred and generic community dynamics approaches must be built to take into account the complexity of population dynamics emerging from fine scale interactions and plant functioning, driven both by the environmental conditions and species strategies. Considering both levels is compulsory to capture the complexity of responses of vegetation communities exposed to diverse drivers.

%
%But 2 things:
%(1) ok to not explicitly represent if know and considered within a broader mech (translated into assumptions: \textit{e.g.}: assumption that stomata regulation), it is not the case of phenotypic plasticity as it is not considered in basic assumptions made. Plus, it depends on the scale, but daily growth require plasticity, period.
%(2) they may greatly change plant and community behaviour in changing conditon/environment.

\chapter{Aims, Objectives and Overview}


\section{Aims: understanding and prediction}

Global change is probably the biggest challenge humanity has to face at the beginning of this millennium. Action is urgently needed to reduce the release of carbon dioxide but also mitigate the effect of climate change on natural and semi-natural systems. While solutions for the former must be found in technology, economics and sociology, the ecology can help with the latter. But it requires understanding on how the drivers impacted by global change will impact these ecosystems . The multiplicity of environmental drivers impacted by global change - whose effects can synergise or balance themselves -, in addition to complex structure and dynamics of natural systems make this understanding hard to build and to summarise.

To go beyond traditional pattern-driven ecology and overcome the difficulty of combined causes leading interacting effects, mechanistic approaches should be privileged. 

The functioning of individuals living in these communities and the dynamics of the resources should be at the core of the new approaches to better understand the trajectories of the ecosystems.

\section{Objectives: a new agent-based model for plant community dynamics} % the why
Traditional empirical approaches of observation and controlled experiments provided valuable information on the functioning of grassland ecosystems. However, they lack power to understand intricate systems and predict their dynamics, especially in case of uncertain scenarios. 

Modelling approaches must be used to build understanding and predictions of natural ecosystems dynamics driven by changing environmental drivers. These models should include a diversity of drivers as well as the diversity and the intrinsic complexity of these systems.

In order to be compensate long development time and to extend the reach of simulation experiments, models should try be generic in structure and flexibility at use, while being specialisabled thanks to parameters or simple equation changes.

\subsection{Generic framework for multi-species and plastic plant modelling} % the how

In the context of mountain grasslands, showing unique levels of diversity despite strong environmental drivers, species diversity cannot be ignored to predict the response of the community. This diversity must be translated into species specific functioning differences leading to diversity in niches and possible responses. In addition to species level dynamics driven by these differences, intra-specific responses cannot be ignored, and a phenotypic plasticity mechanism is needed.



%trade-off that constrain inter and intra differences in the same way

\subsection{Effect of phenotypic plasticity on plant growth, community properties and dynamics}

Intra-psecific variations are expected to play an important role in the response of mountain grassland communities to global change. The effects of phenotypic plasticity and other sources of variations must be disentangled. Explicit integration of species specific phenotypic plasticity in a plant community model will help identify and understand these effects.

As multiple services derive from the main properties of the vegetation of mountain grasslands, it is crucial to establish how phenotypic plasticity specifically impact these properties. Because these properties depend both on properties of the individuals and the relative abundance and diversity of species, effects on processes at both individual and community scales must be investigated.


\section{Thesis overview}

The rest of this thesis is divided in five chapters. The following chapter \ref{part:literature}, in the form of a literature review, introduces the concepts and knowledges that support the approach developed in later chapters. The chapter \ref{part:model} develops the generic framework for plant functioning and phenotypic plasticity from the concepts established in chapter \ref{part:literature} and further extended. Chapters \ref{part:individuals} and \ref{part:community} present respectively individual and community scale results of simulations made with the developed model \model on the effects of phenotypic plasticity on main plant community properties. Finally, the final chapter discusses the outcomes of this work and possible paths to follow from the presented conclusions. Extensions to develop on the model are also proposed.
