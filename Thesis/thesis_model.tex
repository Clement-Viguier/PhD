\chapter*{Abstract}	

\begin{fullwidth}
Mountain grasslands provide numerous ecosystem services that, to be assessed and predicted, need a fine understanding and characterisation to be assessed and predicted. The potential vulnerability to climate change and the complexity of mechanisms underlying alpine community dynamics require the development of new tools to predict the dynamics of these communities under new conditions. Multiple empirical studies show that individual-level variations have large effects on community responses to changes in external condition changes, but they are often overlooked in modelling approaches. %In addition to these effects, intra-specific variability has contrasting potential impacts on coexistence mechanisms that need to be disentangled.
% recent literature highlighted the importance of individual variations for community response to external conditions, while the effects of such intraspecific variations on main coexistence mechanisms are not yet disentangled.\\

To answer both the need for a dynamic model of species-rich communities and the integration of individual variations, the model \model was developed. It is designed around two main components: (1) a closed strategy space allowing an efficient representation of high species diversity, and (2) a plastic allocation mechanism integrating trade-offs between active and structural tissues, as well as between shoot and root tissues.

A specific framework have been developed to integrate plastic strategies within a coherent strategic space revolving around established patterns and allocation trade-offs. The model was then analysed at two levels of organisation: a) the individual growth was studied in single pot simulation; b) the community structure and properties were analysed with plot simulations.

In a first result part, the plant growth was analysed at the individual scale. Beforehand, individual-level growth parameter values were filtered against published empirical data. This first step highlighted the importance of certain parameters and properties of the plastic responses, depending on the algorithms implemented. The combined effect of the algorithms and species specific parameters were then analysed, showing partial agreement between the growth patterns and the behaviour of the plastic allocation. The effect of the plastic allocation was then further studied along resource gradient and resource variability gradient, showing strong potential effects on the properties of the communities. The potential increases in production and species diversity, and the reduction of the function diversity were explained by the modification of the potential niche of the species. The plasticity also showed asymmetric effects in favour of exploitative species under variable conditions.

In a second result part, these potential effects were studied at the community-level. Plot simulations for various sites and parameter sets showed no major effects on the community productivity of the plasticity, suggesting compensating mechanisms between abiotic and biotic limitations. However, these simulations demonstrated a great effect of the phenotypic plasticity on the structure of the community and meta-community by affecting the abiotic and biotic filtering processes. They showed a shift from beta to alpha diversity under plastic allocation. These effects were propagated to the variability of the community's identity. The implication of such effects of such changes were then discussed in the context of the cliamte change.

% after a parameter filtering step, the combined effects of allocation rules, species strategy and phenotypic plasticity on individual plants were studied.

%In a second part, the effect of plasticity was then studied at the scale of the community.


 This work demonstrates the importance of phenotypic plasticity both at the individual scale and its role in community dynamics. While further work is needed to fully capture plasticity mechanisms, the model provides a sound starting point to further explore the role of intra-specific variability in coexistence mechanisms, the resistance and resilience to drought events, or the detection of regime shift in this type of system.

Mountain grasslands provide numerous ecosystem services that, to be assessed and predicted, need a fine understanding and characterisation to be assessed and predicted.

%Mountain grasslands, as many natural or semi-natural systems, provide numerous ecosystem services. Assessing the level of these services is crucial for better management of these systems, and relies on detailed characterisation of the community structure and processes.
%The rise of functional ecology lead to improvement in the understanding and prediction of community assembly rules, response to driver and link to services. But, because the alpine grasslands are vulnerable to global change, and already experience new conditions, traditional patterns are not sufficient enough to predict future alpine community dynamics. There is an urgent need for now predictive and understanding tools to explore diverse scenarios of climate and mangement changes. Moreover, considering the complexity of the mechanisms driving alpine grasslands dynamics,  mechanistic modelling approaches constitute interesting alternative to this challenge. Mechanisstic agent-based models are great tools to explore diverse scenarios and build an understandting of main mechanisms at stake. Furthermore, recent litterature also highlighted the importance of individual variations for community response to external conditions, while the effects of such intraspecific variations on main coexistence mechanisms are not yet disentangled. New mechanistic approaches should focus on individual functioning, and particularly integrate mechanism of individual adaptation to varying conditions, and study its impact at the scale of the community.

%theoretical work: I apologize to colleagues and mountain avicionados, but this work will be more centred around modelling challenges and phenotypic plasticity than around specific mountain processes and extraordianry species diversity.
