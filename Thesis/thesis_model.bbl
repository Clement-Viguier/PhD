      \field{abstract}{* Climate change is expected to increase the magnitude and the frequency of extreme climatic events such as droughts. Better understanding how plant communities will respond to these droughts is a major challenge. We expect the response to be a shift in functional trait values resulting from both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, but little research has addressed the relative contribution of both components. * We analysed the short-term functional response of subalpine grassland communities to a simulated drought by focusing on four leaf traits (LDMC: leaf dry matter content, SLA: specific leaf area, LNC: leaf nitrogen concentration and LCC: leaf carbon concentration). After evaluating species turnover and intraspecific variability separately, we determined their relative contribution in the community functional response to drought, reflected by changes in community-weighted mean traits. * We found significant species turnover and intraspecific variability, as well as significant changes in community-weighted mean for most of the traits. The relative contribution of intraspecific variability to the changes in community mean traits was more important (42–99\%) than the relative contribution of species turnover (1–58\%). Intraspecific variability either amplified (for LDMC, SLA and LCC) or dampened (for LNC) the community functional response mediated by species turnover. We demonstrated that the small contribution of species turnover to the changes in community mean LDMC and LCC was explained by a lack of covariation between species turnover and interspecific trait differences. * Synthesis. These results highlight the need for a better consideration of intraspecific variability to understand and predict the effect of climate change on plant communities. While both species turnover and intraspecific variability can be expected following an extreme drought, we report new evidence that intraspecific variability can be a more important driver of the short-term functional response of plant communities.}

      \field{abstract}{* Despite widespread focus on interspecific variation in trait-based ecology, there is growing evidence that intraspecific trait variability can play a fundamental role in plant community responses to environmental change and community assembly. * Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant communities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and subordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and community-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values. * By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradient, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assemblages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abundance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P concentrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values. * The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species. * The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and highlights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in community-level processes.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology. However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.}

      \field{abstract}{Functional diversity (FD) is a key facet of biodiversity used to address central questions in ecology. Despite recent methodological advances, FD remains a complex concept and no consensus has been reached either on how to quantify it, or on how it influences ecological processes. Here we define FD as the distribution of trait values within a community. When and how to account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV) when measuring FD remains one of the main current debates. It remains however unclear to what extent accounting for population-level ITV would modify FD quantification and associated conclusions. In this paper, we address two critical questions: (1) How sensitive are different components of FD to the inclusion of population-level ITV? (2) Does the omission of ITV obscure the understanding of ecological patterns? Using a mixture of empirical data and simulation experiments, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of four commonly used FD indices (community weighted mean traits, functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, Petchey and Gaston's FD index) and their relationships with environmental gradients and species richness, by varying both the extent (plasticity or not) and the structure (contingency to environmental gradient due to local adaptation) of population-level ITV. Our results suggest that ITV may strongly alter the quantification of FD and the detection of ecological patterns. Our analysis highlights that 1) species trait values distributions within communities are crucial to the sensitivity to ITV, 2) ITV structure plays a major role in this sensitivity and 3) different indices are not evenly sensitive to ITV, the single-trait FD from Petchey and Gaston being the most sensitive among the four metrics tested. We conclude that the effects of intraspecific variability in trait values should be more systematically tested before drawing central conclusions on FD, and suggest the use of simulation studies for such sensitivity analyses.}

      \field{abstract}{Despite being recognized as a promoter of diversity and a condition for local coexistence decades ago, the importance of intraspecific variance has been neglected over time in community ecology. Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics (‘T’ for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities.}

      \field{abstract}{Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.}

      \field{abstract}{Understanding the influence of the environment on the functional structure of ecological communities is essential to predict the response of biodiversity to global change drivers. Ecological theory suggests that multiple environmental factors shape local species assemblages by progressively filtering species from the regional species pool to local communities. These successive filters should influence the various components of community functional structure in different ways. In this paper, we tested the relative influence of multiple environmental filters on various metrics of plant functional trait structure (i.e. ‘community weighted mean trait’ and components of functional trait diversity, i.e. functional richness, evenness and divergence) in 82 vegetation plots in the Guisane Valley, French Alps. For the 211 sampled species we measured traits known to capture key aspects of ecological strategies amongst vascular plant species, i.e. leaf traits, plant height and seed mass (LHS). A comprehensive information theory framework, together with null model based resampling techniques, was used to test the various environmental effects. Particular community components of functional structure responded differently to various environmental gradients, especially concerning the spatial scale at which the environmental factors seem to operate. Environmental factors acting at a large spatial scale (e.g. temperature) were found to predominantly shape community weighted mean trait values, while fine-scale factors (topography and soil characteristics) mostly influenced functional diversity and the distribution of trait values among the dominant species. Our results emphasize the hierarchical nature of ecological forces shaping local species assemblage: large-scale environmental filters having a primary effect, i.e. selecting the pool of species adapted to a site, and then filters at finer scales determining species abundances and local species coexistence. This suggests that different components of functional community structure will respond differently to environmental change, so that predicting plant community responses will require a hierarchical multi-facet approach.}

      \field{abstract}{We investigated the connection between plant species diversity and climate by using a process-based, generic plant model. Different ‘species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a ‘Monte Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant ‘species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of ‘hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful ‘species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant ‘prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful ‘species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of ‘rainy days' and ‘warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the ‘species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.}

      \field{abstract}{A structure–function–diversity model of grassland ecosystems (Gemini) has been developed. For a potentially unlimited number of clonal plant populations, it explicitly simulates competition for two key resources (light and nitrogen) along vertical canopy and soil profiles. Population turnover, shoot and root morphogenesis, photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, N acquisition by uptake, allocation of assimilates between structural compartments, and reserve storage and remobilization, are simulated for each plant population. The object-oriented structure of the modeling framework allows to couple, or not, the simulated plant populations to other sub-models describing climate variables, soil functioning, grazing behavior and grassland management. Partitioning of growth between shoot structures, leaf photosynthetic proteins and roots is based on two assumptions: (i) functional balance between root and shoot activity, (ii) coordination of leaf photosynthesis. The model was parameterized from plant functional trait measurements of 13 native perennial pasture grass species grown in monocultures at high N availability and low cutting frequency in a field trial. Predicted and measured annual dry-matter yields were highly correlated without bias across species, N supply and cutting frequency treatments in monocultures and in mixtures of six species. Results show the ability of this mechanistic model to simulate without bias nitrogen and disturbance responses of net primary productivity and of plant community structure.}

      \field{abstract}{Gemini, a mechanistic model linking plant functional traits, plant populations, community dynamics, and ecosystem scale fluxes in grasslands has been reported in a companion paper (Soussana et al., 2012). For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental data of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant community structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients. The Gemini model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance). Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced ANPP in monocultures and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that, along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance.}

      \field{abstract}{Ecosystems provide important functioning and servic es, like biomass for bioenergy production or storage of atmospheric carbon. Two ex amples of such ecosystems are temperate grasslands and tropical forests. Both vegetation ar e rich of various species, whereby each of the respective ecosystem benefits from its species- richness concerning their functioning, i.e. productivity. In this thesis both vegetation are in the focus of the investigations. In the first chapter, a review of existing grassland and vegetat ion models provides an overview of important aspects, which have to be considered for modelling temperate grasslands in the context of biomass production. Based on the review, new conceptual modelling approaches for temperate grasslands are proposed. In the third chapter, derived from the suggested concept, the process-oriented and individual-based grassland model Grassmind is presented. In the fourth chapter, the model Grassmind is used in order to parameterize and simulate the annual dynamics of a typical Central European grass species. Grassmind is able to reproduce the structure and dynamics of a temperate grass spe cies. With reference to the parameterized grass species, a simulation study using defined spe cies groups is performed in order to investigate on the effect of the richness of specie s groups on aboveground productivity. We do not observe a significant positive effect of specie s group richness on productivity, which is explained by limitations of using the parameterized grass species as a reference. In the fifth chapter, comprehensive investigations are carried o ut on the example of stem size distributions in forests concerning their statistic al analyses, i.e. by using maximum likelihood estimation. The effects of uncertainties, i.e. binn ing of measured stem sizes or random measurement errors, are examined in detail. Uncerta inties bias the analyses of maximum likelihood estimations. It is shown, that the use o f modified likelihood functions, which include either binning or measurement errors, reduc e these biases to a large extent. For both studies, i.e. modelling of temperate grasslands and analysing stem size distributions of forests, the presented investigations are discussed and poss ible examinations are suggested for future research in the last chapter.}

      \field{abstract}{Due to the difficulty to link dynamically and mechanistically the composition, the structure and the individual functions of grassland ecosystem, the ecosystem functioning remains unclear, which limits the prediction of ecosystem response to climatic and management changes. Plant functional traits are proposed as useful tool to link community response to environmental change and consecutive effect on ecosystem functioning. Plant functional trait is morphological, physiological, chemical and phenological characteristic of a plant, which can be transposed to organisation levels of species and community. This thesis deals with traits utilisation in a mechanistic modelling approach in order to link dynamically this hierarchy of organisation levels and, consequently, community response and ecosystem functioning. We used the functional traits of 13 grass species coocurring in mesic grassland, in a biogeochemical model of grassland diversity, GEMINI (Grassland Ecosystem Model with INdividual centered Interactions). This model has been developed, calibrated and used to understand the role of plant traits for the response of these species to two cut frequencies and two N fertilisation levels in monocultures and in mixtures in terms of productivity, plasticity and abundance. In first time, a model hypothesis concerning the leaf C:N stoichiometry has been validated. This leaf photosynthesis coordination hypothesis states a co-limitation of photosynthesis by light-driven and dark biochemical reactions. It has been tested by using a database of 31 species belonging to 6 plant functional groups and growing in different environmental conditions. This hypothesis explained without bias 92\% of total variance of leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area by the variations of three leaf photosynthetic traits. The model equations of substrates allocation between leaf structures and leaf photosynthetic proteins are therefore validated and calibrated. In second time, functional traits linked to root N acquisition and shoot N utilisation (N productivity efficiency and N residence time in tissue) have been measured in field monoculture on 13 species. We showed mechanistically the fundamental relationships linking root and shoot traits (size vs physiological activity specialization axes). Moreover, we highlighted interspecific trade-offs between: i) the root uptake capacities of NO3 - and NH4 + and ii) root area developed in resource patch and root N uptake. These results allowed the integration of root and leaf traits implied in N plant strategies in the calibration of GEMINI for each grass species. Once the model development completed, the simulations showed several emergent properties: 1) after defoliation and nitrogen deprivation, the plastic adjustments of relative size of structural compartments and of their physiological activities restore the functional balance leading to a colimitation of plant by light, nitrogen and CO2; 2) at equilibrium state, the size and the tiller density simulated by the model covary according to a -3/4 power coefficient. The model allows the simulation of vegetative production variations between species and between two cut frequencies and two N fertilisation levels both in monocultures and in mixtures. The observed ranks of grasses relative abundance are well predicted in different six species mixtures. Finally, the model simulates a positive biodiversity effect on the production of 6 species mixtures, which overproduce in comparison of each species in monoculture with the same initial tiller density. When the model is simplified, its prediction ability is degraded. The actual version of the model gives interesting perspective in terms of fundamental question in community ecology and in functional ecology. We provide an application example by investigating the origin of covariations between morphological traits observed in natura. For four traits representative of functional strategies of 13 grass species, a systematic study in 4D space built by these traits showed that: 1) the measured traits value maximizes the simulated growth for each of these species; 2) the individual plasticity observed in response to N deprivation maximizes the simulated growth. These results increases the understanding about the constraints imposed by intra-and-inter-specific trade-offs on the performance and the plasticity of these grass species across resource gradients.}

      \field{abstract}{Background and Aims Simple models of herbaceous plant growth based on optimal partitioning theory predict, at steady state, an isometric relationship between shoot and root biomass during plant ontogeny, i.e. a constant root–shoot ratio. This prediction has received mixed empirical support, suggesting either that optimal partitioning is too coarse an assumption to model plant biomass allocation, or that additional processes need to be modelled to account for empirical findings within the optimal partitioning framework. In this study, simulations are used to compare quantitatively two potential explanations for observed non-isometric relationships, namely nutrient limitation during the experiments and initial developmental constraints. Methods A simple plant growth model was built to simulate the growth of herbaceous species, based on optimal partitioning theory combined with empirically measured plant functional traits. Its ability to reproduce plant relative growth rate and final root weight ratio was assessed against previously published data. Predicted root–shoot ratios during plant ontogeny were compared with experimental observations. The effects of nutrient limitation and initial developmental constraints on root–shoot ratios were then tested. Key Results The model was found to reproduce overall plant growth patterns accurately, but failed, in its simplest form, at explaining non-isometric growth trajectories. Both nutrient limitation and ontogenetic developmental constraints were further shown to cause transient dynamics resulting in a deviation from isometry. Nitrogen limitation alone was not sufficient to explain the observed trajectories of most plant species. The inclusion of initial developmental constraints (fixed non-optimal initial root–shoot ratios) enabled the reproduction of the observed trajectories and were consistent with observed initial root–shoot ratios. Conclusions This study highlights the fact that considering transient dynamics enables theoretical predictions based on optimal partitioning to be reconciled with empirically measured ontogenetic root–shoot allometries. The transient dynamics cannot be solely explained by nutrient limitation during the experiments, pointing to a likely role for initial developmental constraints in the observed non-isometric growth trajectories.}

      \field{abstract}{Ecological theory suggests that environmental variability can promote coexistence, provided that species occupy differential niches. In this study, we focus on two questions: (1) Do allocation trade-offs provide a sufficient basis for niche differentiation in succulent plant communities? (2) What is the relative importance of different forms of environmental variability on species diversity and community composition? We approach these questions with a generic, individual-based simulation model. In our model, plants compete for water in a spatially explicit environment. Species differ in their size at maturity and in the allocation of carbon to roots, leaves and storage tissue. The model was fully specified with independent literature data. Model output was compared to characteristics of a species-rich community in the semi-arid Richtersveld (South Africa). The model reproduced the coexistence of plants with different sizes at maturity, the dominance of succulent shrubs, and the level of vegetation cover. We analyzed the effects of three forms of environmental variability: (a) temporal fluctuations in precipitation (rain and fog), (b) spatial heterogeneity of water supply due to run-on and run-off processes and (c) ‘rock pockets’ that limit root competition in space. The three types of variability had differential effects on diversity: diversity exhibited a strong hump-shaped response to temporal variation. Spatial variability increased diversity, with the strongest increase occurring at intermediate levels of temporal variability. Finally, rock pockets had the weakest effect, but contributed to diversity by providing refuges for small species, particularly at low temporal variability. The model thus shows that spatio-temporal variation of resource supply can maintain diversity over long time scales even in small systems, as is the case in the Richtersveld succulent communities. Trade-offs in allocation provide the basis for necessary niche differentiation. By describing resource competition between individual plants, our model provides a mechanistic basis for the link from species traits to community composition at given environmental conditions. It thereby contributes to an understanding of the forces shaping plant communities. Such an understanding is critical to reduce the threats environmental change poses to biodiversity and ecosystem services.}

      \field{abstract}{A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes. The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C–S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region. The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance. The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.}

      \field{abstract}{* Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that are measured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. * A variety of linear and nonlinear methods were used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in the most comprehensive data set. * The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits. * Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs whenever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining community assembly across different ecosystems.}

      \field{abstract}{Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.}

      \field{abstract}{Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today’s terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.}

      \field{abstract}{* The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. * Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). * There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. * Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. * Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow’ plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.}

      \field{abstract}{A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food.}

      \field{abstract}{How expected increases in climate variability will affect species diversity depends on the role of such variability in regulating the coexistence of competing species. Despite theory linking temporal environmental fluctuations with the maintenance of diversity, the importance of climate variability for stabilizing coexistence remains unknown because of a lack of appropriate long-term observations. Here, we analyze three decades of demographic data from a Kansas prairie to demonstrate that interannual climate variability promotes the coexistence of three common grass species. Specifically, we show that (i) the dynamics of the three species satisfy all requirements of “storage effect” theory based on recruitment variability with overlapping generations, (ii) climate variables are correlated with interannual variation in species performance, and (iii) temporal variability increases low-density growth rates, buffering these species against competitive exclusion. Given that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous in natural systems, our results suggest that coexistence based on the storage effect may be underappreciated and could provide an important alternative to recent neutral theories of diversity. Field evidence for positive effects of variability on coexistence also emphasizes the need to consider changes in both climate means and variances when forecasting the effects of global change on species diversity.}

      \field{abstract}{Variation in leaf life-span has long been considered of ecological significance.Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life-span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns. Among all species, both mass- (A"m"a"s"s) and area-based (A"a"r"e"a) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life-span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P {<}.001, r{^}2 = 0.70) than an area (P {<}.05, r{^}2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass-based leaf nitrogen (leaf N"m"a"s"s) decreased (P {<}.001, r{^}2 = 0.52) with leaf life-span, but area-based leaf N (leaf N"a"r"e"a) did not (P {>}.25, r{^}2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life-span. Decreasing A"m"a"s"s with increasing leaf life-span results from the impact of decreasing N"m"a"s"s and SLA on A"m"a"s"s. Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life-span was similar for broad-leaved and needle-leaved subsets of the data. These leaf-scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, N"m"a"s"s, and A"m"a"s"s) the quantitative relationship with leaf life-span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. A"m"a"s"s was a linear function of N"m"a"s"s (P .001, r{^}2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while A"a"r"e"a was not significantly related to N"a"r"e"a. These results suggest that the photosynthesis-leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis. Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole-plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P {<} .001, r{^}2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and A"m"a"s"s (r{^}2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and A"m"a"s"s and RGR were also positively related (r{^}2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P {<} .001, r{^}2 = 0.72) and increased with A"m"a"s"s (P {<} .001, r{^}2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life-span and high leaf N"m"a"s"s, SLA, LAR, and A"m"a"s"s interactively contribute to high growth rates in open-grown individuals. These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed-canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P {<} .001, r{^}2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life-span or total foliage mass (P {<} .001, r{^}2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing A"m"a"s"s, N"m"a"s"s, and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaf life-spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life-span. Extended leaf life-span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand-level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life-span. We hypothesize that co-variation among species in leaf life-span, SLA, leaf N"m"a"s"s, A"m"a"s"s, and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short-term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand-level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf life-span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as casually interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.}

      \field{abstract}{BackgroundPlant functional traits co-vary along strategy spectra, thereby defining trade-offs for resource acquisition and utilization amongst other processes. A main objective of plant ecology is to quantify the correlations among traits and ask why some of them are sufficiently closely coordinated to form a single axis of functional specialization. However, due to trait co-variations in nature, it is difficult to propose a mechanistic and causal explanation for the origin of trade-offs among traits observed at both intra- and inter-specific level.Methodology/Principal FindingsUsing the Gemini individual-centered model which coordinates physiological and morphological processes, we investigated with 12 grass species the consequences of deliberately decoupling variation of leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf lifespan) and plant stature (height and tiller number) on plant growth and phenotypic variability. For all species under both high and low N supplies, simulated trait values maximizing plant growth in monocultures matched observed trait values. Moreover, at the intraspecific level, plastic trait responses to N addition predicted by the model were in close agreement with observed trait responses. In a 4D trait space, our modeling approach highlighted that the unique trait combination maximizing plant growth under a given environmental condition was determined by a coordination of leaf, root and whole plant processes that tended to co-limit the acquisition and use of carbon and of nitrogen.Conclusion/SignificanceOur study provides a mechanistic explanation for the origin of trade-offs between plant functional traits and further predicts plasticity in plant traits in response to environmental changes. In a multidimensional trait space, regions occupied by current plant species can therefore be viewed as adaptive corridors where trait combinations minimize allometric and physiological constraints from the organ to the whole plant levels. The regions outside this corridor are empty because of inferior plant performance.}

      \field{abstract}{The objective of this study was to clarify the changes in the contents of endogenous carbohydrates and proline in the stolons and leaves of centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack.), during the natural cold acclimation (hardening) and de-acclimation (dehardening) in relation to freezing tolerance in the field at the transition zone between temperate and subtropical areas in China. The contents of carbohydrates and proline, and freezing tolerance estimated by LT50, which is the temperature at which 50\% of the electrolytes in the organ was measured in the leachate, were determined at 10-day intervals from October 1, 2001 to April 18, 2002. It was indicated that the freezing tolerance of stolons increased (LT50 of stolons decreased) quickly, as temperature dropped before winter, but that of leaves which senesced along with the drop in temperature did not. The freezing tolerance of stolons decreased gradually along with the rise in temperature above 5 °C in spring, when the overwintered plants started to grow. The contents of proline and soluble carbohydrates, including sucrose, fructose and glucose, increased as LT50 decreased when temperature dropped below 5 °C before winter, and decreased as LT50 increased in early spring. Correlation analysis revealed that the freezing tolerance of stolons of centipedegrass significantly and positively correlated with the contents of proline and soluble carbohydrates, and the ratio of the soluble carbohydrates to starch. Thus, the freezing tolerance of stolons, which are critical organs that determine the winter surviving ability, largely depended on the content of soluble carbohydrates and the ratio of soluble carbohydrates to starch in centipedegrass. The possible relationship between freezing tolerance and carbohydrate metabolism was also discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories - dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A `mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.}

      \field{abstract}{* 1Our goal was to determine the relationships among ecophysiological, whole-plant and ecosystem traits of a wide variety of grassland species grown under field conditions in the long term. We measured 87 traits for 33 species (32 perennial, one annual) grown in monoculture for 5 years on sandy soils, and determined the relationship among traits and their correspondence with current functional classifications. * 2Among non-legumes, species that produced and maintained large amounts of biomass had tough, low-activity leaves and roots, high root : shoot ratios, and low extractable inorganic nitrogen and N mineralization in their soils. The set of correlations among the functional traits of fine roots for non-legumes parallels the set of correlations for leaf functional traits. Low-N species maintained greater biomass than high-N species, more by producing tissues with low N concentrations and greater longevity than by acquiring more N. Greater relative production below ground, and the production of long-lived below-ground structures, were both important in determining the high root : shoot ratio of species. * 3For legumes, N2 fixation not only led to greater above-ground biomass production, but also was associated with low fine root production; greater relative production of stem biomass; and accelerated ecosystem N cycling compared to non-legumes. * 4The measured traits, as condensed via principal components analysis, differentiated the 32 species into groups that corresponded with a common grassland functional classification scheme (C3 grasses, C4 grasses, forbs, legumes, woody species) as well as an alternative, continuous approach. For all traits, species can be arrayed well along two continuous axes. The first axis separates cool-season and warm-season legumes; the second low-N and high-N non-legumes. * 5These continuous classifications show the generality of the two strategies for dealing with low nitrogen availability (N2 fixation and the low-N suite of traits) and extends the strategies to span organ-level traits to ecosystem processes including roots, whole-plant patterns of productivity, and nutrient cycling. The correlations of traits among species will also be useful in predicting a large number of important parameters associated with plant growth from the measurement of a few, key traits.}

      \field{abstract}{• We tested the hypothesis that biological trait-based plant functional groups provide sufficient differentiation of species to enable generalization about a variety of plant ecophysiological traits or responses to nitrogen (N). • Seedlings of 34 North American grassland and savanna species, representing 5 functional groups, were grown in a glasshouse in an infertile soil with or without N fertilization. • Forbs, C$_{\textrm{3}}$ and C$_{\textrm{4}}$ grasses, on average, had similar relative growth rates (RGR), followed in declining order by legumes and oaks, but RGR varied greatly among species within functional groups. All measured attributes differed significantly among functional groups, of these, only RGR and photosynthesis differed among functional groups in response to N. All groups, except the legumes, had significantly greater photosynthetic and respiration rates at elevated N supply. Principal components analyses and cluster analyses yielded groupings that corresponded only moderately well to the biologically based a priori functional groupings. • Variation in RGR among species and treatments was positively related to net CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) and net assimilation rate, but unrelated to leaf area ratio. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were related to tissue \%N among treatments and species. Our data indicate that RGR and related traits differ among the functional groups in significant ways, but in a complex pattern that does not yield simple generalizations about relative performance, controls on RGR, or response to resource supply rate.}

      \field{abstract}{Plant communities can respond to environmental changes by altering their species composition and by individuals (within species) adjusting their physiology. These responses can be captured by measuring key functional traits among and within species along important environmental gradients. Some anthropogenic changes (such as fertilizer runoff) are known to induce distinct community responses, but rarely have responses across natural and anthropogenic gradients been compared in the same system. In this study, we used comprehensive specific leaf area (SLA) data from a diverse Australian annual plant system to examine how individual species and whole communities respond to natural and anthropogenic gradients, and to climatically different growing seasons. We also investigated the influence of different leaf-sampling strategies on community-level results. Many species had similar mean SLA values but differed in SLA responses to spatial and temporal environmental variation. At the community scale, we identified distinct SLA responses to natural and anthropogenic gradients. Along anthropogenic gradients, increased mean SLA, coupled with SLA convergence, revealed evidence of competitive exclusion. This was further supported by the dominance of species turnover (vs. intraspecific variation) along these gradients. We also revealed strong temporal changes in SLA distributions in response to increasing growing-season precipitation. These climate-driven changes highlight differences among co-occurring species in their adaptive capacity to exploit abundant water resources during favorable seasons, differences that are likely to be important for species coexistence in this system. In relation to leaf-sampling strategies, we found that using leaves from a climatically different growing season can lead to misleading conclusions at the community scale.}

      \field{abstract}{Extreme drought events can dramatically impact grassland ecosystems, causing potential loss of forage production for livestock in temperate grasslands. However, knowledge of drought effects on forage production, nutritive value and plant community stability in the real context of farming management is scarce. For this purpose, the effect of a simulated summer drought was studied under two realistic management types on a semi-natural grassland in the Swiss Jura mountains. The first management (“grazing”) consisted in six consecutive utilizations by animals over the growing season, representing a rotational grazing system as regionally conducted. The second management (“mowing”) consisted of three harvests, corresponding to the usual mowing frequency of hay meadows. In both managements, drought caused minor short-term modifications of species composition and almost no persistent effects were observed. Besides, important short-term changes were observed in community weighted mean of several key functional traits, reflecting a strong decline in community growth during the drought followed by a partial recovery two months later. Forage yields, and to a lesser extent its nutritive value, thus declined during the drought period. Both were still affected in the following months, but had recovered in spring of the following year. Forage loss was twofold higher in the grazing management, but recovery as well as nutritive value was slightly improved in this management. The results suggest that rotational grazing can amplify negative drought impacts, compared to traditional mowing, and highlight the need to adapt such management in dry years. They also demonstrate that, even under a fairly intensive management, resilience of such mountain grasslands after one extreme drought event can be expected to be high, with no persistent changes in species and trait compositions.}

      \field{abstract}{1. Under nutrient-poor conditions initially fast-growing species will in the long term be competitively inferior to slow-growing species. Here, we ask whether this phenomenon can be explained by constraints caused by tissue density. The hypothesis is that low tissue density is necessary for fast growth but has as a consequence short organ life span. This leads to a rapid loss of nutrients that cannot be sustained under nutrient-poor conditions. 2. Biomass accumulation, turnover rate of leaves and roots, and tissue density were studied for five ecologically contrasting grass species. Plants were grown in a garden experiment over two growing seasons on sand with a low nutrient supply level. 3. Species that were characteristic of nutrient-rich sites had a low leaf and root tissue density and were larger after one growing season than species of nutrient-poor sites. However, after two growing seasons the species of nutrient-poor sites were larger. These species had a high tissue density. 4. Life span of both leaves and roots was also correlated with tissue density. Species with low tissue density had a faster turnover of leaves and roots. 5. It is concluded that tissue structure is an inherent constraint that prevents simultaneous maximization of both nutrient acquisition and nutrient conservation. The short life span of fast-growing organs explains the long-term disadvantage of a high growth rate for plants in low nutrient conditions.}

      \field{abstract}{Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems. We present an approach to explaining LMA from the numbers, dimensions and mass densities of leaf cells and tissues, which provided unprecedented explanatory power for 11 broadleaved woody angiosperm species diverse in LMA (33–262 g m−2; R2 = 0.94; P {<} 0.001). Across these diverse species, and in a larger comparison of evergreen vs. deciduous angiosperms, high LMA resulted principally from larger cell sizes, greater major vein allocation, greater numbers of mesophyll cell layers and higher cell mass densities. This explicit approach enables relating leaf anatomy and composition to a wide range of processes in physiological, evolutionary, community and macroecology.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent work has identified a worldwide “economic” spectrum of correlated leaf traits that affects global patterns of nutrient cycling and primary productivity and that is used to calibrate vegetation–climate models. The correlation patterns are displayed by species from the arctic to the tropics and are largely independent of growth form or phylogeny. This generality suggests that unidentified fundamental constraints control the return of photosynthates on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves. Using novel graph theoretic methods and structural equation modeling, we show that the relationships among these variables can best be explained by assuming (1) a necessary trade-off between allocation to structural tissues versus liquid phase processes and (2) an evolutionary trade-off between leaf photosynthetic rates, construction costs, and leaf longevity.}

      \field{abstract}{Leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and internal leaf anatomy often affect net gas exchange because of their effects on internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation, internal shading, competition for CO2 among carboxylation sites, nitrogen concentration and its partitioning. To evaluate effects of LMA and leaf anatomy on CO2 assimilation, water-use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), we measured LMA, leaf thickness, the thickness of mesophyll components, and gas exchange rates at ambient CO2 concentration in leaves of six woody deciduous and evergreen species with different leaf life spans. In two species, CO2 assimilation was also estimated at saturating CO2 concentrations. There were interspecific differences in all morphological variables studied. Long-lived leaves had higher LMA and were thicker than short-lived leaves. Species with high LMA had low assimilation rates and NUE, both in ambient and saturating CO2 concentrations. Thus, in species with high LMA, assimilation was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, possibly because of a lower allocation of N to the photosynthetic machinery than in species with low LMA. Within a species, thicker leaves tended to have a lower tissue density. In intraspecific comparisons under field conditions, increasing internal air volume had positive effects on WUE, probably because of enhanced internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation. We conclude that, in interspecific comparisons, different patterns of N partitioning strongly influence NUE, whereas in intraspecific comparisons, internal leaf anatomy is a key factor regulating resource-use efficiency.}

      \field{abstract}{abstract: When a plant invests in construction of a leaf, the revenue‐stream that accrues is shaped by three variables: first, the light‐capture area per milligram dry mass invested, analogous to a potential rate of return on investment; second, the longevity of the leaf, analogous to the expected duration of the revenue stream; and third, a time‐discount rate, quantifying the fact that light‐capture area deployed in the immediate future is more valuable to the plant than the same area deployed at some later time. Recent comparative data make it possible to quantify the cross‐species trade‐off between the first variable and the second variable. Here we develop an approach through which the consequences of the third variable, the time‐discount rate, can be related to the trade‐off between the first variable and the second variable. The approach involves an equal‐benefit set, the cross‐species equivalent of a fitness set. A wide spread of strategies is actually observed to coexist in vegetation, from low to high light capture area per gram and, correspondingly, from high to low leaf longevity. The coexistence suggests that the different observed strategies do not have a clear‐cut advantage over the other. The equal‐benefit set can be used to investigate what levels of time discount would make it the case that neither the highest‐longevity nor the highest light‐capture area per milligram strategies would have a clear advantage over the other, with regard to the time‐discounted value of the revenue stream generated per milligram invested in leaf.}

      \field{abstract}{Questions It remains unresolved why, despite the obvious functional importance of leaves and roots, co-existing plant species can display highly contrasting biomass distributions of these organs. Building on the ‘functional equilibrium’ hypothesis, we hypothesize that co-existing species can each achieve balanced resource acquisition above vs below ground by trading off the biomass vs morphology of structures responsible for resource acquisition, i.e. leaves and fine roots. Methods We tested this hypothesis in a natural field setting by measuring plant above- and below-ground biomass and morphological traits associated with resource uptake – specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) – of 18 dominant angiosperm species from a sub-alpine plant community. Location New Zealand South Island. Results We found a significant negative relationship between the species leaf mass to fine root mass ratio and the SLA to SRL ratio when we considered eudicot species only. The SLA to SRL ratio and plant size explained 31\% and 34\% of the total variation in the species leaf to fine root mass ratio respectively, and 45\% when used in combination (P {<} 0.05 in all cases). Within a given plant size, 90\% of the variation among species in total leaf area was due to differences in SLA, whereas variation in the fine root mass fraction was responsible for 71\% of the variation among species in fine root length. Conclusions In support of our hypothesis, part of the difference between co-occurring species in leaf and fine root biomass distribution could be explained by the variable morphologies of these organs as well as variation in plant size, independent of the plant economic strategy. We expect that this outcome may result from environmental and evolutionary constraints on plant species-average traits, as well as plastic responses to local environmental conditions. These findings help explain why a diversity of strategies for achieving balanced resource acquisition can co-exist within a single plant community.}

      \field{abstract}{Leaf economics spectrum (LES), characterizing covariation among a suite of leaf traits relevant to carbon and nutrient economics, has been examined largely among species but hardly within species. In addition, very little attempt has been made to examine whether the existence of LES depends on spatial scales. To address these questions, we quantified the variation and covariation of four leaf economic traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents) in a cosmopolitan wetland species (Phragmites australis) at three spatial (inter-regional, regional, and site) scales across most of the species range in China. The species expressed large intraspecific variation in the leaf economic traits at all of the three spatial scales. It also showed strong covariation among the four leaf economic traits across the species range. The coordination among leaf economic traits resulted in LES at all three scales and the environmental variables determining variation in leaf economic traits were different among the spatial scales. Our results provide novel evidence for within-species LES at multiple spatial scales, indicating that resource trade-off could also constrain intraspecific trait variation mainly driven by climatic and/or edaphic differences.}

      \field{abstract}{Functional trait plasticity is a major component of plant adjustment to environmental stresses. Here, we explore how multiple local environmental gradients in resources required by plants (light, water, and nutrients) and soil disturbance together influence the direction and amplitude of intraspecific changes in leaf and fine root traits that facilitate capture of these resources. We measured population-level analogous above- and belowground traits related to resource acquisition, i.e. “specific leaf area”–“specific root length” (SLA–SRL), and leaf and root N, P, and dry matter content (DMC), on three dominant understory tree species with contrasting carbon and nutrient economics across 15 plots in a temperate forest influenced by burrowing seabirds. We observed similar responses of the three species to the same single environmental influences, but partially species-specific responses to combinations of influences. The strength of intraspecific above- and belowground trait responses appeared unrelated to species resource acquisition strategy. Finally, most analogous leaf and root traits (SLA vs. SRL, and leaf versus root P and DMC) were controlled by contrasting environmental influences. The decoupled responses of above- and belowground traits to these multiple environmental factors together with partially species-specific adjustments suggest complex responses of plant communities to environmental changes, and potentially contrasting feedbacks of plant traits with ecosystem properties. We demonstrate that despite the growing evidence for broadly consistent resource-acquisition strategies at the whole plant level among species, plants also show partially decoupled, finely tuned strategies between above- and belowground parts at the intraspecific level in response to their environment. This decoupling within species suggests a need for many species-centred ecological theories on how plants respond to their environments (e.g. competitive/stress-tolerant/ruderal and response-effect trait frameworks) to be adapted to account for distinct plant-environment interactions among distinct individuals of the same species and parts of the same individual.}

      \field{abstract}{This chapter focuses on evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants. The expression of an individual genotype is modified by its environment. The amount by which it can be modified is termed its plasticity. This plasticity can be either morphological or physiological; these are interrelated. The plasticity of a character is related to the general pattern of its development, and apart from this, that plasticity is a general property of the whole genotype. Plasticity of a character appears to be specific for that character, specific in relation to particular environmental influences, specific in direction, under genetic control not necessarily related to heterozygosity, and able to be radically altered by selection. Because plants are static organisms, plasticity is of marked adaptive value in a great number of situations. Examples of all these situations in plant species are discussed. They indicate that adaptation by plasticity is a widespread and important phenomenon in plants and has evolved differently in different species. The mechanisms involved in plasticity are varied. At one extreme, the character shows a continuous range of modification dependent on the intensity of the environmental stimulus. At the other, the character shows only two discrete modifications. The stimulus causing these modifications may be direct or indirect. The mechanisms found can be related to the particular environmental situation involved.}

      \field{abstract}{The ability of a genotype to change its phenotype was once considered rather a nuisance – making it difficult to define a genotype. This led to the idea that there was a problem called ‘instability’. But quite early it was recognized that stability was under genetic control, and was a character like other attributes of an individual. From this realization came the idea that there were two sides to the character of ‘instability’, and that the ability to change could be important. This ability was thus given the title of ‘plasticity’. Once recognized, it became clear from surveys of different species and populations that plasticity can (i) be a complex character, and (ii) be selected to fit species to the particular demands of different environments. For plants, which cannot meet variations in environment like animals by behavioural responses, phenotypic plasticity can be very important. Plants should therefore be valuable tools for unravelling the mechanisms of plasticity whilst also demonstrating its contribution to fitness experimentally. We ought also to be able to demonstrate that appropriate genetic variability is available through which complex responses can be built up by selection. Genes must exist not only to determine character means, but also to determine character response, which adds interesting complexity to our ideas about evolution.}

      \field{abstract}{Trade-offs between acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources were investigated by studying the phenotypic plasticity of leaf and root traits in response to different irradiance levels at low nutrient supply. Two congeneric grasses with contrasting light requirements, Dactylis glomerata and D. polygama, were used. The aim was to analyze phenotypic covariation in components of leaf area and root length in response to above- and belowground resource limitation and the consequences of this variation for resource acquisition and plant growth. At intermediate shading (30 and 20\% of full sunlight) the plants were able to maintain their total root length, despite a strongly increased total leaf area and a reduced biomass allocation to roots. This was associated with an unaltered or slightly increased nutrient uptake and growth. At 5.5\% relative irradiance, growth was severely reduced, especially in the shade-tolerant D. polygama. The results show that constraints on acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources, caused by biomass allocation, may be alleviated by plasticity in other traits such as tissue-mass density and thickness of roots and leaves. The results also suggest different adaptive constraints for phenotypic plasticity and for genetically determined interspecific variation. Phenotypic plasticity tends to maximize resource acquisition and growth rate in the short term, whereas the higher tissue-mass density and the longer leaf life-span of shade-tolerant species indicate reduced loss rates as a more advantageous species-specific adaptation to shade in the long term.}

      \field{abstract}{* Despite widespread focus on interspecific variation in trait-based ecology, there is growing evidence that intraspecific trait variability can play a fundamental role in plant community responses to environmental change and community assembly. * Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant communities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and subordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and community-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values. * By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradient, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assemblages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abundance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P concentrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values. * The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species. * The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and highlights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in community-level processes.}
