\chapter{The dead end plasticity}

WHen resource is limited in amount, the exchange rate is always overestimated that leads to plant exaustion. It would matter if the condition does not change, both plant would probably die quickly, but it does if conditions change. -> discussion about being patient or reactive, and when to pay the price... This should feed the discussion about the interest of plasticity as implemented here as a strategic factor.\\
Arise from the instantaneous view of plasticity, that might not be selected. Reaction norm can give you plasticities that would not emerge from this system of rule, but could be selected in an evolutionary context.
